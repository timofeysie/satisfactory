[{'summary_text': ' Holi is named after Holika, the demoness aunt of a kingï¿½s disloyal son in a myth . Effigies of Holika burnt throughout the holiday reference this myth . The ritual of throwing colored powder, traditionally known as gulal, and water is rooted in the legend of Radha and Krishna . In that tale, a young Krishna, the Hindu god of protection, compassion, tenderness and love, doused Radha with colors on her face out of jealousy .'}]
