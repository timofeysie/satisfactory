# Mashup Type

Add the mashup option to the two image selection cards here:

libs\trends\src\lib\components\topic-form\topic-form\topic-form.component.ts

When the onTypeSelectionChange() is called, we can possibly create a tab for two images to be selected it.
Or we can add an thumbnail of the image selected in the card.  This sounds like a better way to reduce the ... what?  Forgot what I was saying.

When onSelectedCommonsImage() gets called, we can check the type.

For mashups, add the image to a thumbnail image on the card.

We still don't know the user will determine which image selected is for which picture.

Could show a toggle.
