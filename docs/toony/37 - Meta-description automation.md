Title: Hailey Bieber

Original text "Hailey Bieber has addressed reports of a recent hospitalization. In a post on her Instagram Story, she explained what happened on Thursday, March 10. She was taken to the hospital with a blood clot, which caused a lack of oxygen. She wrote that she is doing well and is grateful for the doctors and nurses who took care of her. Just prior to her hospitalization, Justin Bieber had posted a supportive photo of her with him."
