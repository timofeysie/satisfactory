# link out or embed images

Photobucket provides users with several linking options:

- Direct link: This is the actual web location where your image is stored. Use this link for sites that ask you to insert an image from a web URL.

- HTML code: Use this to embed a photo or video on forums or websites like Blogger, eBay, and more!

- IMG link: Use this to embed your photo or video on message boards and forums that do not allow you to input HTML coding.

- Email & IM: Use this link to share your image or album via email or IM. This link will send you directly to Photobucket to view the content.
