"Your ad units are not displaying ads because you haven't provided your account payments information yet."

When I action the alert, there is no option to provide account payments information.

The steps for this are:

How to set up your form of payment
1. Sign in to your AdSense account.
2. Click Payments.
3. Click Manage payment methods.

The answer for missing payment methods is:

*You can only add a payment method once you have sufficient funds on the payments page in your AdSense account. If you only started on YT this month, your earnings won't transfer to AdSense until after the month is over (it would be between August 7th and 10th).*

But how can I get any ad money if there are no ads displaying?  It's a catch 22.
