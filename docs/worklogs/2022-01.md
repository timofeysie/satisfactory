## The failing summaries

It seems like if a particular search fails then

```txt

It worked in an incognito browser, so possibly caching issues?

Turns out we were calling the bart.py, but had made changes to goose.py to use only that script. Changing that brought back our summaries.

The OK, not OK error handling for goose and bart is still an issue however.

## srcset

The srcset field for two type artist does not expand like the input for one.

## <span class="padding">{{ article.timeAgo }}</span>

The cards are crowded. Added some margin.

## The snake

The trend detail article said:

```txt
WATCH: Mink drags snake across road in the Everglades
NBC2 News
X
COPELAND, Fla. – A pair of hikers caught the moment a mink crossed a road carrying a large snake in its mouth in Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park.
```

The bart goose said:

```txt
After failing field sobriety exercises, the 44-year-old was arrested and taken to the Naples Jail Center. The man was taken into custody after failing field\xa0obeseety\xa0exercises. He was taken to a local jail where he is being held on charges of DUI and possession of marijuana. The arrest occurred in Naples, Florida, at the time of the incident.
```

It seems like if must have gotten an ad for another story instead.

### Commit "fixed the srcset logic"

## Download images

Using the getCommonsImgSource() we get this commonsImgSource:

What about .png file extensions?

I created a kind of embarrassing function called findExtension() which looks for the third dot in the img tag string and returns that with the dot, such as '.jpg' or '.png'.

Seems to work OK, until it doesn't...

You should use the link name (by default, the name of the linked service) as the hostname to connect to.
So just use host: 'db' instead of host: 'localhost'
```

## 18th

Fixed the issue with the truncated urls. This was due to a title with a dot in it.

This issue also turned up:

This is the summary created by the server:

```txt
loadSummary [{'summary_text': ' Calvin Kattar defeats Giga Chikadze by unanimous decision in featherweight fight . Jake Collier submits Chase Sherman in the co-main event . Kaitlyn Chookagian defeats Jennifer Maia in a rematch in a women\'s flyweight title rematch . Kattagian and Maia met in 2019; the
"Blonde Fighter" won a rematch last year .'}]
```

But the form gets pre-filled like this:

```txt
won a rematch last year.
```

And, the url download is causing this error:

```txt
gan.controller: downloadImage
links https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/1971_Chrysler_Valiant_%28VG%29_Regal_Safari_station_wagon_%282015-07-10%29_02.jpg

```

The url works in the browser indicating that this is a cors issue.

But we already use the setting in our nest app: app.enableCors();

I then used a different approach to the https lib.

```js
  @Post()
  async downloadImage(@Body() linkWrapper: any) {
    const name = this.parsePath(linkWrapper.links[0]);
    console.log('gan.controller: downloadImage', name);
    const writer = fs.createWriteStream('apps/toonify/src/test_img/'+name.filename);
    const response = await this.httpService.axiosRef({
      url: linkWrapper.links[0],
      method: 'GET',
      responseType: 'stream',
    });
    response.data.pipe(writer);
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      writer.on('finish', resolve);
      writer.on('error', reject);
    });
  }
```

## 22

The hugging face output needs to also use the name of the file so that a call for a particular topic brief will result in the correct file being loaded, not whichever was last time if there was an error.

Just using something from the json as the file name would work.

Here is what the json looks like:

```json
{
  "title": "Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ...",
  "timeAgo": "2h ago",
  "source": "ABC News",
  "image": {
    "newsUrl": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/australian-open-ash-barty-wins-naomi-osaka-amanda-anisimova/100774764",
    "source": "ABC News",
    "imageUrl": "https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQueliwziIoIBz2XL_Ot6rZE1U9yQbm-R4SLR94mH_53HWNAmJnTz2aVsJ3m0Agld7GuwxFL3Os"
  },
  "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/australian-open-ash-barty-wins-naomi-osaka-amanda-anisimova/100774764",
  "snippet": "Ash Barty will face Amanda Anisimova in the last 16 after the unseeded American ended Naomi Osaka&#39;s Australian Open title defence in a gripping three-set&nbsp;..."
}
```

We really need to start collecting the date.

This is not hacking it: date=now+7-d

While we are here, we also need to capture the originalTrendTitleUsed to create the description.

That title is what we should use for the file name.

"Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ..."

We will save that property, and use it for the filename like this

originalTrendTitleUsed: "Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ..."
Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open.txt

Or should the ellipsis be used? Is that OK for a filename?

Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ....txt

I'm thinking that we should use just the current setup which uses the url to the source.

event https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/entertainment/meat-loaf-obit/index.html

So the filename on the backend would be

https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/entertainment/meat-loaf-obit/index.html.txt

If that actually works, and there are no errors going to be caused by that in the future, then that's fine.

Currently it's summary.txt.

What is the save and what is the load api functions?

```ts
@Get() findAll() { return this.bartService.loadSummary(); }
@Get(':id') findOne(@Param('id') id: string) { return this.bartService.findOne(id); }
@Post() async getArticleSummary(@Body() article: any) { ... }
```

The bart.service.loadSummary() function needs to get the name.

Can we encode the url, send it to the get/id and then call loadSummary that way?

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-22/australian-open-alex-de-minaur-through-to-fourth-round/100775774.txt

}

Need to use the built-in encodeURIComponent(summaryUrl) function:

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Fnews%2F2022-01-22%2Faustralian-open-alex-de-minaur-through-to-fourth-round%2F100775774.txt    
bart.controller.findAll
bart.service.loadSummary()

But the route is still using the get with no param.

OK, yeah, Fox Sports snuck in a result there and I didn't notice.  It works now.

What's next?  Confirm more fields in the generated JSON.

### Alex_de_Minaur

Both links are valid.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur

https://apnews.com/hub/alex-de-minaur

I select both use checkboxes.  But they are not added:

```json
  "links": {
    "newsLink": "",
    "useAPNewsLink": true,
    "addAPNewsContent": "",
    "wikiLink": "",
    "useWikiLink": "true",
    "addWikiLinkContent": ""
  },
```

The Wikipedia link does get set:

"linkUrl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John Madden",

But we should put those is an array in the links section.

At some point we want an array of labels and links from any source, but that's not essential for now.

It's used like this:

```ts
    this.newNewsLink = 'https://apnews.com/hub/' + dashTitle;
    this.newWikiSearchTerm = this.trendTitleSeen;
    this.topicForm.controls.linkUrl.setValue(this.newNewsLink);
    this.topicForm.controls.links['newsLink'].setValue(this.newNewsLink); <-- added
    ...
    onUpdatedNewsSearchTerm() {
     this.newNewsLink = this.topicForm.value.links.newsLink;
    }
```

Actually, it's not emitting, and this value was never implemented.  I think it was expected that these would all be replaced by arrays, which is a much bigger task and has been moved to post-MVP work.

So time to fill the newsLink.  

### AP newsLink

We will need to add a newsLinkLabel as well.

loading Taylor Fritz
trends.component.ts:171 onHandleNewAPSearchTerm undefined
core.js:6456 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setValue')
    at TrendsLinksComponent.ngOnInit (libs_trends_src_index_ts.js:877:51)

Which one is it?

    this.topicForm.controls.linkUrl.setValue(this.newNewsLink);

    this.topicForm.controls.links['newsLink'].setValue(this.newNewsLink);

The second one causes the error.  Not sure why.  Printing out the links object, the value shows it alone is undefined.

value:
addAPNewsContent: ""
addWikiLinkContent: ""
newsLink: undefined

The default value is being overridden.  It must be the emitter is, but why is that not working?

trends-links.component.ts:27 set this.newNewsLink https://apnews.com/hub/Dow-Jones

trends.component.ts:171 new value onHandleNewAPSearchTerm undefined

trends-links sends a new value, but trends receives undefined.

It seems like a normal emitter setup.

I think we are missing an extra form control:

this.topicForm.controls.one['controls']?.commonImg?.setValue(image);

this.topicForm.controls.links['newsLink']?.setValue(this.newNewsLink);

The issue along with making sure to use a controls for each form group, there was no event in our event in the parent class.  So the above should be:

this.topicForm.controls.links['controls']['newsLink'].setValue(this.newNewsLink);

Also, following the smart/dumb component pattern, we want to emit the local child value of the link and let all the setting of form values happen in the parent smart component.

Can anyone notice the error here?

(handleNewAPSearchTerm)="onHandleNewAPSearchTerm()"

It should include the event or the parent will receive an undefined value.

(handleNewAPSearchTerm)="onHandleNewAPSearchTerm($event)"

#### 2-Error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token % in JSON at position 0

To encode or not encode?  It should maybe be done in the Nest bart.controller:

```js
  @Post()
  async getArticleSummary(@Body() article: any) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      this.bartService.getArticleSummary(article.link).then((result: any) => {
        resolve(encodeURIComponent(result));
      });
```

No, then it looks for the summary.txt:

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summary.txt'

Wait, why isn't the post method getting called?

If there is no article by that name, then the frontend gets this error in what class?

GET http://localhost:3333/api/bart/ 500 (Internal Server Error)

Just remember to actually try the submit.

At least the AP news link is working.  But the label is not.

```json
"newsLink": "https://apnews.com/hub/Ash-Barty",
"newsLinkLabel": "",
```

That fixed, now it's time to figure out what the regression is on the summary feature.

OK, so this is the error:

err TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "chunk" argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer. Received an instance of ArrayBuffer

So parse the string and it works.  Here are some of the details.

```txt
S3 URI: s3://one-public-bucket/Diego_Verdaguer_Hayao.jpg
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) arn:aws:s3:::one-public-bucket/Diego_Verdaguer_Hayao.jpg
Entity tag (Etag): 99914b932bd37a50b983c5e7c90ae93b
Object URL: https://one-public-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Diego_Verdaguer_Hayao.jpg
```

As yet, I'm not sure if the image is getting uploaded.  Look at the file size:

Diego_Verdaguer_Hayao.jpg	jpg	January 29, 2022, 12:27:14 (UTC+11:00)	
2.0 B
Standard

Is that 2 bytes?

Downloading it, this is the file contents: {}

So maybe parsing the file is not working for us.  Trying new Buffer(file).  This works, but the Buffer has a line through it (deprecated?) and we get this error (but a successful image uploaded to the bucket):

(node:7036) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.

That's all and nice, but it works for now.  As someone smart said, don't optomize something that shouldn't exist.  Since this is just research, it will do as is.

Another note is that the file was not found in some cases, because of special characters in the filename.  So we again used the built in encode function of Javascript and it worked everytime.

Now about that null result in the front end.  This is what the gan.service resolves:

```js
{
  ETag: '"543515071bd4facf36d20878ae353b32"',
  Location: 'https://one-public-bucket.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Blake_Powell_2014_Shinkai.jpg',    
  key: 'Blake_Powell_2014_Shinkai.jpg',
  Key: 'Blake_Powell_2014_Shinkai.jpg',
  Bucket: 'one-public-bucket'
}
```

At least the file size is correct now: 19.3 KB

I mean, we can save that result in a file and let the front end use it as part of another api call, but it would be great to have that go to the front end.

I thought after encoding the filename, then the problem was gone but apparently not:

```txt
gan.service.upload: err [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img\Daniil_Medvedev_(35531013405)_Paprika.jpg'] {
  errno: -4058,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
```

The file is encoded:

apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img\Daniil_Medvedev_%2835531013405%29_Paprika.jpg

In this case, that's being done by the toonify python script.  So maybe we shouldn't be encoding the file we are looking at.  Maybe we will have to read the directory and load one that we can match?

But wait, the above is obtained from the front end open file modal.

The frontend actually has this error:

```err
core.js:6456 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    at PostCreationFormComponent.upload (post-creation-form.component.ts:72:45)
    at PostCreationFormComponent_Template_input_change_50_listener (post-creation-form.component.html:107:25)
    at executeListenerWithErrorHandling (core.js:15272:1)
```

The errors continue:

core.js:6456 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at TrendsComponent.getCommonsImageUrl (trends.component.ts:286:55)

That's an exception to our weak method for getting the large wikimedia file url.

<img 
src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Jason%27s_Deli%2C_North_Little_Rock.JPG/135px-Jason%27s_Deli%2C_North_Little_Rock.JPG"

loading="lazy" class="sd-image" 
style="height: 100% !important; max-width: 2448px !important; max-height: 3264px;">

So it's the uppercase JPG there I think.  Have to use the toLowerCase() Javascript funtion.

Now, back to the real error:

gan.service.upload: err [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img\Daniil_Medvedev_(35531013405)_Paprika.jpg'] {

Using the built in encodeURIComponent didn't work for some reason.  I ended up doing this out of frustration:

    const remove = id.split('(').join('%28');
    const brackets = remove.split(')').join('%29');

But there will be other characters that come along and break things.

Why doesn't encodeURIComponent work?

## Save S3 upload results

Currently, the files saved contain [object Object].

I tried JSON.parse.  This SO answer provided the correct way to write the file:

```js
function writeConfig(obj) {
        fs.writeFile('./config.json', JSON.stringify(obj, undefined, 2), function (err) {
            if (err) console.log(err);
        });
}
```

### .jpg.json

This is not the best file extenstion I have seen:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Maddie_Ziegler_May_2015_(cropped)_Hayao.jpg.json

The problem with say replacing the .jpg with _jpg is that since we are using the filename as the id, we might make mistakes when trying to convert back when loading.

At this point, it's not a great issue.  Really we should be creating a uuid which is a good idea, but as yet, we don't know the order of how things should be created and so don't want to optimize things that will change in the future.

## { value: 'KR', label: 'South Korea' }

A lot of things work from the start.

But not this:

Request URL: http://localhost:3333/api/images/%EC%9D%B4%EC%86%8C%EC%97%B0
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error

Also, we want to add the country chosen to the form.

## For change log

- created S3 result file
- added check for uppercase file extensions
- manually encoding brackets
- added South Korea to country types for testing.

Added date and country to the file, pictureNumber.imageChosen
