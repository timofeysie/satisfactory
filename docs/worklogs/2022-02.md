So far we are getting the selected image filename but the file is not being opened:

```txt
au Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg
[Nest] 14788   - 01/02/2022, 8:19:00 pm   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json' +448213ms
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json'
```

The actual file is:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg.json

apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json

How does %28 become %2528?  DOuble encoding?

The filename before the encoding is:

writeBucketFile.fileTitle Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg

OK, so that was the problem.  After this, we have attaches an s3 property to each picture.

Right now however, I don't think it would work for a post with two AI generated images.

Since we aren't planning for that, it wont matter much at this point.  Let the automation continue!

I think next we need to create a preview which will display the data from the json in a sample post.
