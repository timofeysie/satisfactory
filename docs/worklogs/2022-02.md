# Work log

So far we are getting the selected image filename but the file is not being opened:

```txt
au Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg
[Nest] 14788   - 01/02/2022, 8:19:00 pm   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json' +448213ms

```

The actual file is:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg.json

apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json

How does %28 become %2528?  DOuble encoding?

The filename before the encoding is:

writeBucketFile.fileTitle Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg

OK, so that was the problem.  After this, we have attaches an s3 property to each picture.

Right now however, I don't think it would work for a post with two AI generated images.

Since we aren't planning for that, it wont matter much at this point.  Let the automation continue!

I think next we need to create a preview which will display the data from the json in a sample post.

## no such file or directory

Is this still an issue?

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Sierra_Sunrise_and_Moonfall%2C_CA_2016_%2830370749223%29_Paprika.jpg.json'
    at Object.openSync (fs.js:498:3)

### Moonfall repair

I had to repair the posted form from the console log output.
Kind of a waste of time.  But I liked the image.  The articles looked like this:

"articles": [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ],

It's more useful to figure out why the automation failed here.

I wish we had a Perry Fotakopoulos post.  The Paprika picture turned out to be really special.

Perry_Fotakopoulos%2C_Socceroos._Paprika

Need to add these to the product post:

    "newsLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://apnews.com/hub/https://apnews.com/hub/Aubameyang",
    "newsLinkLabel": "Aubameyang on AP News",

Remember, not all json files have the label.

## Set <AI> name from image selected model

That part is easy enough, but there is an error on post:

```txt

```

But the error must be before that, as there is no json file written for the post.

Allen%27s_80th_book_of_berries_%281965%29_%2817924239616%29_Hayao.jpg.json

Above that, I am seeing this error:

```txt
