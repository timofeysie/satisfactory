# Work log

So far we are getting the selected image filename but the file is not being opened:

```txt
au Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg
[Nest] 14788   - 01/02/2022, 8:19:00 pm   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json' +448213ms

```

The actual file is:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg.json

apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json

How does %28 become %2528?  DOuble encoding?

The filename before the encoding is:

writeBucketFile.fileTitle Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg

OK, so that was the problem.  After this, we have attaches an s3 property to each picture.

Right now however, I don't think it would work for a post with two AI generated images.

Since we aren't planning for that, it wont matter much at this point.  Let the automation continue!

I think next we need to create a preview which will display the data from the json in a sample post.

## no such file or directory

Is this still an issue?

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Sierra_Sunrise_and_Moonfall%2C_CA_2016_%2830370749223%29_Paprika.jpg.json'
    at Object.openSync (fs.js:498:3)

### Moonfall repair

I had to repair the posted form from the console log output.
Kind of a waste of time.  But I liked the image.  The articles looked like this:

"articles": [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ],

It's more useful to figure out why the automation failed here.

I wish we had a Perry Fotakopoulos post.  The Paprika picture turned out to be really special.

Perry_Fotakopoulos%2C_Socceroos._Paprika

Need to add these to the product post:

```txt
"newsLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://apnews.com/hub/https://apnews.com/hub/Aubameyang",
"newsLinkLabel": "Aubameyang on AP News",
```

Remember, not all json files have the label.

## Set <AI> name from image selected model

That part is easy enough, but there is an error on post:

But the error must be before that, as there is no json file written for the post.

Above that, I am seeing this error:

```

Not sure what's going on yet or why the last two form posts didn't get written.  Now, I am seeing a file for Man U.

The one.author is set correctly, but not the author settings:

"authors": "<AI>, <ARTIST>",

To accomplish this, we need a remove button on the two form group and remove that from the json, and the authors.  Then when we replace <AI>, it will be all done automatically.

## FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3]

The system cannot find the path specified: 'apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/'

Everything was working fine yesterday in the morning, but all of a sudden the gan stopped generating images.  The error I am getting is: FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/'

Since this directory exists, and was working previously, it may be something has changed in the version of Python being used.  At least that's what some StackOverflow answers indicate.

Here was the log that shows up in the NestJS console.  It doesn't actually show the error:

The BART worked and created a summary, but no images were generated.

Using the test api also fails to generate images.

## Lata Example

This is the log from a pretty successful post.  The images and the text summary were both generated eventually, after more than 30 seconds.  But the log may be useful in the work to get a response from the server when the generated files are available.   The dream is push notifications, but until then...

This is followed by Rayan Morocco, where the summary text fails.

The post also fails:

This means the upload to the s3 bucket failed.  Still, I don't know what part of the app this is talking about.  It could be the create or the save or the load.  We get that in the stack trace.

If we can catch this error, then we can alert the user that the filename needs to change.
Or deal with it in the code.  I guess the latter is a better option.

Currently if this happens it wont break the post.  But then we would have to manually upload the image we want and create the s3 bucket property on the json.  I suppose in this case we want to add a blank s3 property and let the user fill it in.

But even doing that, the filename looks like this:

%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D9%85%D9%83%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3_Hosoda.jpg

Also, the <AI> is not being replaced on the main json author property.

"authors": "<AI>, ",

If the two picture is removed, then this is where we get with title.

## Links

The initial idea was:

- Add a news links option to set from one of the trending stories.

I want the news link to get set automatically to one of the trending searches.

This is quite a feature to just throw in.

It will need to be hard-wired so on going to the post form, the content is either associated by an id/field, and then at some point copied to the news link field.

But then, we will also want to display the same brief which consists of the following elements;

- image
- 4h ago
- source
- brief headline
- description

This means displaying all this in the post, alongside the Wikipedia link.

Maybe we want to do the same for the Wikipedia entry?

And, actually Wikipedia does have search result cards of it's own, so great feature really given we need more content.  It doesn't all have to be original does it?

Also, this display format will represent the same kind of layout that the whole post will show up as in Google anyway.  I've been thinking that we need to add the google search results preview for the post.

How about, as well as adding the SERP to the links section, add to the post to the SERP list which is currently called the product-list.

Wait, then we also want the AP link now to have the same format.

This means:

1. add checkbox to include SERP as news link
2. show SERP news link card in preview
3. create Wikipedia SERP card
4. create post SETP preview to add to the list
5. find AP replacement source for Australia stores

Here is what a SERP/article element looks like:

```json
"articles": [
  {
    "title": "Brooklyn Nets dismissed Philadelphia 76ers&#39; interest in James ...",
    "timeAgo": "4h ago",
    "source": "ESPN",
    "image": {
      "newsUrl": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33236290...",
      "source": "ESPN",
      "imageUrl": "https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9..."
    },
    "url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33236290brooklyn...",
    "snippet": "In the the one single exchange betwe... (total 156 characters)"
  },
```

Snippets is the meta-description I think.  That's about 150 characters there before its truncated.

### In AU, 20K+ Kelly Slater, in the US its 50K+

We will want to keep track of a few examples like this to show the different markets, and specifically, how much bigger the US is.

### Changelog

- Allowed removing image two to allow for single AI created art.
- Added next/previous product detail navigation.
- Set the post author based on the selected generated image
- product-detail layout improvements

Commit: allowed removing image two and added next previous product detail nav

## Weekend update

When choosing an image that was generated, got this error:

core.js:6456 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type')
    at SafeSubscriber._next (trends.component.ts:226:38)

Yet another thing that needs to be handled after removing the "two" part of the form.

I'm really regretting not creating an array of images instead of hard-wiring "one" "two" elements into the form/json.

### Clean up time

Made a function to delete the contents a working folders.

Put the button on the list of posts page for want of a better idea of where to put it.

## B & E files

Two files showed up in the source directories.

B
E

Where did these come from?  Here is a hint:

gan.controller: downloadImage { path: '', filename: 'E' }

Yes, there is it, but the correct file was downloaded.  So there must be something else going on.

This app is becoming a big boy now, with complex big boy hard to debug problems.

Also, I need to do my taxes this weekend.

OK.  Code monkey, listen up:

*When you cut and past code, you got to change what you need to change.  If you can't do that, then don't cut and paste code!*

The issue was this:

```ts
this.trendsService.downloadImages(seed).subscribe((result) => {
```

Got to call the new service, not the one you copied the call from!

## Generating text

http://localhost:3333/api/generate/Texas%20Chainsaw%20Massacre

Request URL: <http://localhost:3333/api/generate/Texas%20Chainsaw%20Massacre>
Request Method: GET
Status: 500

Eventually we see this:

```txt
Texas Chainsaw Massacre - The Killing of a Sacred Deer
The Chainsaw Massacre - The Killing of a Sacred Deer
```

That's pretty appropriate.  See, this could be useful.  I'm still not sure why it's repeating itself.  We will have to check from that and remove the repeats if there are not settings which will do that automatically.

Anyhow, now for the hard part that needs to happen everywhere: wait on the backend until it can generated new content from a model.

apps\nest-demo\src\app\generate\generate.controller.ts

```ts
@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param('id') id: string) {
  return await this.generateService.generateText(id);
}
```

OK, got it.  I took out a reject() statement there and now it looks like this:

```ts
  async generateText(id: string) {
    const process = spawn('python', [
      'apps/hugging-face/src/text_generator.py',
      id,
    ]);
    return await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      process.stdout.on('data', function (data) {
        console.log(data.toString());
        resolve(data.toString());
      });
    });
  }
```

The result is still pretty useless for most cases:

Lindsey Pearlman, a former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, said the administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement was "a mistake.""The Paris agreement is a disaster for the United States," she said.

It's like it just akes the name and then replaces another name with is.

Using this as a seed:  television actress, found dead

Result:

```txt
television actress, found dead �in her home in the early hours of Sunday morning.
The cause of death was not immediately known.
The cause of death was not immediately known.
The cause of death was not immediately known.
```

If it was just a matter of removing dup;icated text, that would be doable.

However, it's just wrong.  She was was found dead 3.5 miles from her home.

So, it's back to the drawing board.  Could hire a professional.

## Copy to clipboard

The icon to use:

<i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i>

The Angular version:

```js
import { faCopy } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
...
faCopy = faCopy;
```

<fa-icon [icon]="faCopy"></fa-icon></a>

Angular Material has a directive for that.

<button [cdkCopyToClipboard]="value">Copy to clipboard</button>

Putting them together

```html
    <button class="menu-spacer"
    [cdkCopyToClipboard]="trendTitleSeen">
      <fa-icon
        [styles]="{ stroke: 'blue', color: 'blue' }"
        [icon]="faCopy"
      ></fa-icon>
    </button>
```

We also might need this:

in the materials.module:

import { ClipboardModule } from '@angular/cdk/clipboard';

in the trneds.module:

import { ClipboardModule } from '@angular/cdk/clipboard';

Not sure which.
