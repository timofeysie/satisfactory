# Work log

So far we are getting the selected image filename but the file is not being opened:

```txt
au Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg
[Nest] 14788   - 01/02/2022, 8:19:00 pm   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json' +448213ms
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json'
```

The actual file is:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg.json

apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%25283983322185%2529_Hayao.jpg.json

How does %28 become %2528?  DOuble encoding?

The filename before the encoding is:

writeBucketFile.fileTitle Session_with_Bungie_at_PAX_2009_%283983322185%29_Hayao.jpg

OK, so that was the problem.  After this, we have attaches an s3 property to each picture.

Right now however, I don't think it would work for a post with two AI generated images.

Since we aren't planning for that, it wont matter much at this point.  Let the automation continue!

I think next we need to create a preview which will display the data from the json in a sample post.

## no such file or directory

Is this still an issue?

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Sierra_Sunrise_and_Moonfall%2C_CA_2016_%2830370749223%29_Paprika.jpg.json'
    at Object.openSync (fs.js:498:3)

### Moonfall repair

I had to repair the posted form from the console log output.
Kind of a waste of time.  But I liked the image.  The articles looked like this:

"articles": [ [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object], [Object] ],

It's more useful to figure out why the automation failed here.

I wish we had a Perry Fotakopoulos post.  The Paprika picture turned out to be really special.

Perry_Fotakopoulos%2C_Socceroos._Paprika

Need to add these to the product post:

```txt
"newsLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://apnews.com/hub/https://apnews.com/hub/Aubameyang",
"newsLinkLabel": "Aubameyang on AP News",
```

Remember, not all json files have the label.

## Set <AI> name from image selected model

That part is easy enough, but there is an error on post:

```

But the error must be before that, as there is no json file written for the post.

Allen%27s_80th_book_of_berries_%281965%29_%2817924239616%29_Hayao.jpg.json

Above that, I am seeing this error:

```txt

```

That's the upload failing for some reason:

```ts
  async uploadImage(file, originalFileName) {
    const bucketS3 = 'one-public-bucket';
    if (file.buffer) {
      return await this.uploadS3(file.buffer, bucketS3, originalFileName);
    } else return 'error';
  }
```

That's an array of objects.  Why is it saved as text?

```

Not sure what's going on yet or why the last two form posts didn't get written.  Now, I am seeing a file for Man U.

The one.author is set correctly, but not the author settings:

"authors": "<AI>, <ARTIST>",

To accomplish this, we need a remove button on the two form group and remove that from the json, and the authors.  Then when we replace <AI>, it will be all done automatically.

## FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3]

The system cannot find the path specified: 'apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/'

Everything was working fine yesterday in the morning, but all of a sudden the gan stopped generating images.  The error I am getting is: FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/'

Since this directory exists, and was working previously, it may be something has changed in the version of Python being used.  At least that's what some StackOverflow answers indicate.

Here was the log that shows up in the NestJS console.  It doesn't actually show the error:

```txt

The BART worked and created a summary, but no images were generated.

Using the test api also fails to generate images.
