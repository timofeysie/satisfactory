## New Py Scripts

### Notes added to the NST_notes.md file

- apps/toonify/src/NST_train_single_image.py >> Run this file to train NST on a new style and input pair. At least 2000 epochs are recommended.

- apps/toonify/src/stylization_script.py >> Run this file to transfer input image into pre-trained styles. There are 4 pre-trained models are available in models/binaries folder.

- apps/toonify/src/training_script.py >> To train NST on new style. This will save the pre-trained model which can be used to transfer images afterwards.

- apps/toonify/src/utils/ >> This utils folder consists of scripts for download pre-trained models from dropbox and other helper functions.

### Answer

I have a question about these files: NST_train_single_image.py, stylization_script.py and training_script.py

When I used the NST script, I just used a style image and an input image and called NST.py like this:
python apps/toonify/src/NST.py --input_dir input.jpg --style_image style.jpg --output_dir gen_img

(I guess you renamed NST.py to NST_train_single_image.py, right?)
Anyhow, your notes seem to indicate I need to train images on the style images first?
You're notes seem to suggest that there is a lot more involved:
Run this file to train NST on a new style and input pair. At least 2000 epochs are recommended.
Run this file to transfer input image into pre-trained styles. There are 4 pre-trained models are available in models/binaries folder.
To train NST on new style. This will save the pre-trained model which can be used to transfer images afterwards.

To train NST on new style. This will save the pre-trained model which can be used to transfer images afterwards.

### NST_train_single_image.py

This one uses one of the pre-trained models so it's not training here. This is the main file to use.

### stylization_script.py

I have not trained with this one as it requires huge data and more time but just added here in case you want to train your own style. Once you train using this script it saves the pre-trained models that you can later use in stylization_script.py

### training_script.py

You don't have to train unless you want a new style.

## Previous use of the NST script

The script was called like this:

python apps/toonify/src/NST.py

```py
parser.add_argument(
    '--input_dir', default='C:/Users/timof/repos/timofeysie/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Trump-Kim_Summit_June_2018_v4.jpg')
parser.add_argument(
    '--style_image', default='C:/Users/timof/repos/timofeysie/satisfactory/apps/toonify/src/style_img/Overlooking_Stampa_Augusto_Giacometti_(1908).jpg')
...
save_image(generated_image, "gen_" + opt.input_dir)
```

Here is the list of [commits](https://github.com/timofeysie/satisfactory/commits/develop) to figure out how to use the scripts.

### Scripts added

Scripts and commit messages:

```txt
NST_train_single_image.py - NST new pre-trained models and training code
stylization_script.py - NST new pre-trained models and training code
test.py - NST pre-trained models and training code
test_image_cyclegan.py - Cyclegan pre-trained models and test script
training_script.py - NST new pre-trained models and training code
```

In test.py, paths were changed to relative paths:

parser.add_argument('--input_dir', default = './test_img/')

However, the generate images does not seem to be working anymore.

I have seen some strange images in the apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img directory.

Why are these files there?

Alex_De_Minaur_%2828938823637%29_sezanne.jpg
Alex_De_Minaur_%2843875330731%29_sezanne.jpg
Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1991-014-09%2C_Stein-Pfalz%2C_Ritter_und_Justin_bei_Blutabnahme_sezanne.jpg

I think these must be the failed images El was talking about.  Was that using the Cezanne model.  Since his French name has an accent over the e: Paul CÃ©zanne, I'm guessing that's what that encoded character is: %29_sezanne

When I run the test.py script from the command line, I get this:

```txt
> python apps/toonify/src/test.py --style Hosoda --gpu 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\test.py", line 27, in <module>

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './pretrained_model/Hosoda_net_G_float.pth'
PS C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory>
```

Change the new version:

parser.add_argument('--input_dir', default = './test_img/')

Back to the old version:

parser.add_argument('--input_dir', default='dist/apps/public/')

And it works.

## What happened to the download images?

```ts

    // download images
    this.downloadImages();
```

}

[Nest] 8544   - 08/03/2022, 12:46:24 am   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\test_img\President_Joe_Biden_with_the_Milwaukee_Bucks_%2803%29.jpg' +349800ms
```

Did the download happen and the image just not save?

If we look at the response object, it seems to indicate yes:

gan.controller.downloadImage: axios ref response {
  status: 200,
  statusText: 'OK',
  headers: {
    date: 'Mon, 07 Mar 2022 05:15:42 GMT',

The error is in the reject block in the gan.controller.downloadImage() function which previously worked:

```ts
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      writer.on('finish', () => this.ganService.kickOffGan());
      writer.on('error', () => { reject }
```

So look at the path used.

C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\test_img\President_Joe_Biden_with_the_Milwaukee_Bucks_%2803%29.jpg' +349800ms

C:\Users\timof\repos\timofeysie\satisfactory-broken\apps\toonify\src\test_img

Right.  The repos position has change because the develop branch lost it's ref and the project was re-cloned and moved up a directory.  Where is there a hardwired path?

There were no directories:

- test_img
- gen_image
- cartooned_img

Someone needs to remember that these directories will have to be created if the project is moved again or cloned by someone else.  Why aren't they in the git repo?  They are not in the gitignore.  As far as is know, the app does not hard-wire the satisfactory directory anywhere

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fearthesword.com%2F2022%2F3%2F7%2F22964370%2Fevan-mobley-offensive-rebounding-breakdown.txt'

Maybe we need the apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries directory also?

The post is made, but there is no S3 bucket upload.  Here we go again:

writeBucketFile: File not found ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/Zydrunas_Ilgauskas_Cleveland_Cavaliers_Hayao.jpg.json

Create that directory, but then we see this error:

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/https%3A%2F%2Fmeaww.com%2Frobert-kraft-dana-blumberg-engaged-tommy-hilfiger-engaged.txt
gan.service.upload: err [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img\Brian_Nord,_Becoming_Interplanetary_Paprika.jpg'] {

A simple solution would be to create the directory if it doesn't exist.  Does FS have such a function?  If not, here is the list of paths that do not exist when a repo is cloned:

### Directories needed

- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/test_img
- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/gen_image
- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/cartooned_img
- ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries
- ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket/

## Back to the generate list function

Now that the download, generate and upload are working again, it's back to this.

apps\nest-demo\src\app\products\products.service.ts

The faulty logic goes something like this:

```ts
fs.readdir('./posts', (err, files) => {
  const articles = [];
  for (const [index, file] of files.entries()) {
    fs.readFile('./posts/' + file, 'utf-8', (err, file) => {
      const jsonFile = JSON.parse(file);
      const article = { ... fill properties ... }
      articles.push(article);
    })
  }
  console.log('articles', articles.length);
})
```

However, we get 0 each time for the articles, because the fs functions are async.

readFileSync could be used, but it has a different signature than the async version.

Trying async/await didn't change anything.

Just doing this in a procedural way works:

```ts
const fileContents = fs.readFileSync('./posts/' + file, 'utf-8');
```

## Cycle Gan

El - Sat, Mar 05: have just pushed cyclegan
there are 4 pre-trained models but only one is generating some reasonable images
will modify the notes tomorrow morning

apps\toonify\src\test_image_cyclegan.py

python apps\toonify\src\test_image_cyclegan.py --file apps\toonify\src\test_img\Paddy_Pimblett_ufc.jpg

Or this:

```shell

Changed this:

```py
# Load state dicts
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(
    args.model_name, map_location=torch.device('cpu')), strict=False)
```

And get this:

Random Seed:  8122
cost 0.8493s
```

This should be the output dir:

apps\toonify\src\cartooned_img

apps\toonify\src\pretrained_model\vangogh_net_G_float.pth

python apps\toonify\src\test_image_cyclegan.py --file apps\toonify\src\test_img\Paddy_Pimblett_ufc.jpg --model-name apps\toonify\src\pretrained_model\vangogh_net_G_float.pth

This doesn't do much.  I can see why it was abandoned.

### Tooltips to add

done - Wikipedia link: Edit the ex`tension to create a link, ie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ + text in the field below and press 'update'.

done - News link: AP News is the preferred link, but add any full url link to be used in the field below and press 'update'.

done - types: A single AI type requires only one Type section, the second one can be deleted.  An AI vs Art post requires two Type sections.  A mashup type requires two also.

### Mashup types

- Show two images that will be downloaded?
done - Add link label and link url fields on the post form under the current link fields to edit the AP/other links.

### Random

done - Add "copy to meta-description" button next to "Use generated summary" button.

That might be the angular.json file, but the answer is a one liner so doesn't say.

## Mashup second news link label and url fields

While adding these, saw this error:

core.js:6456 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at TrendsComponent.getCommonsImageUrl (trends.component.ts:427:55)

Looks like an issue with the extension function.

const ext = this.findExtension(urlPage);

It's a terrible function.  The second image is not getting downloaded either.

We need to show the user the selected image in the card also.  Not the image, but the url.

The findExtension: urlPage <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Logo_Boston_Bruins_1934.gif/147px-Logo_Boston_Bruins_1934.gif" data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Logo_Boston_Bruins_1934.gif/147px-Logo_Boston_Bruins_1934.gif" alt="Logo Boston Bruins 1934.gif" loading="lazy" class="sd-image" style="height: 100% !important; max-width: 445px !important; max-height: 545px;">

It's a gif.  Duh.

So downloadImages.two is undefined

<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Logo_Boston_Bruins_1934.gif>

Seems to be working now.

We really need scrape text buttons in the trends list and then separate summarize buttons in the post form!

Done - Also, make a mashup of Mikel Arteta and the stadium to complete that post.
Done - Added date to articles list and calcDateAgo function.

## Scrape text buttons in the trends list

Add a new button on the list to kickoff the download of the text from the article in question.

Also add the button for the Wikipedia/AP news article.  The Wikipedia one would have to be slightly different, as we only can summarize a small amount of text, so it would have to be broken up into sections.  This is actually a good intro to doing that for articles also.  Many articles are too long to run BART on.  So splitting them up into sections can be added to this feature while also accommodating for Wikipedia content.

To start, put a download icon button here:

libs\trends\src\lib\components\trends-list-detail\trends-list-detail\trends-list-detail.component.html

emit the url to here:

libs\trends\src\lib\containers\trends-list\trends-list.component.html

This has to again emit the url up to the trends.component where it can call the service.

this.trendsService.kickoffArticleSummary(url);

I know we want to have a separate scrape feature.  But for now, we can call that service, then have another chooser in the post creation form to choose a successfully summarized article.  Small steps.

The bart.service.getArticleSummary will write a file like this:

./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/
https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Ffannation%2Fsoccer%2Ffutbol%2Fvideo%2Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt

Now we need a file select to retrieve that in the form.  Use the "Choose generated image" modal as a guide.

@Output() chooseArticleSummary = new EventEmitter<any>();

After connecting the summaryInput file selector, we are getting this error:

GET <http://localhost:3333/api/bart/https%253A%252F%252Fwww.si.com%252Ffannation%252Fsoccer%252Ffutbol%252Fvideo%252Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt> 500 (Internal Server Error)

The server says:

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\https%253A%252F%252Fwww.si.com%252Ffannation%252Fsoccer%252Ffutbol%252Fvideo%252Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt.txt'

It's looking for this file:

https%253A%252F%252Fwww.si.com%252Ffannation%252Fsoccer%252Ffutbol%252Fvideo%252Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt.txt'

But it's actually called this:

https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Ffannation%2Fsoccer%2Ffutbol%2Fvideo%2Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt

https%3A%2F%2Fwww

has become:

https%253A%252F%252Fwww

So that's an encoding issue.

%252Ffutbol

%2Ffutbol

OK, so this arrives at the trends.component.onChooseArticleSummary: 
https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Ffannation%2Fsoccer%2Ffutbol%2Fvideo%2Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt

This file in the summaries directory is:

https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Ffannation%2Fsoccer%2Ffutbol%2Fvideo%2Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt

So that's right.  But then the server looks for:

https%253A%252F%252Fwww.si.com%252Ffannation%252Fsoccer%252Ffutbol%252Fvideo%252Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt.txt'

The bart.controller gets:

https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Ffannation%2Fsoccer%2Ffutbol%2Fvideo%2Freal-madrid-0-4-barcelona-highlights-and-clasico-match-stats.txt

The damage happens in the bart.service.loadSummaryById(summaryUrl: string) function:

```ts
    const summaryFilename = encodeURIComponent(summaryUrl);
    console.log('bart.service.loadSummaryById:', summaryUrl);
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const path = `./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/${summaryFilename}.txt`;
```

I guess we should either:

A: create a new version of the controller/service to handle the choose operation.
B: move that processing into the Angular service so that the backend service can be shared.

Do I need to say that B is better?  The only think is that's risking breaking the existing functionality.  Also, it's breaking the SOLID rule of single responsibility.  That's the first rule!

But what about the rule of "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY)?  In this case, I think keeping it DRY is more important.  It's still the same responsibility.  And, I think the old method is on it's way out.  That was really limiting, only being able to load the same file that you had chosen before.  Now you can load multiple descriptions and choose your favorite.  The old function will probably be removed eventually.  In fact, I think I don't even care if it's broken now as I will be using the new version only.

Strange, but the mashup type downloads work for Barcelona.  They humiliate Real Madrid one more time!

## News link issue

When working on Tundra 64, it was found that the news links created junk links like this:

```json
  "links": {
    "newsLink": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://apnews.com/hub/https://apnews.com/hub/Aubameyang",
    "newsLinkLabel": "Aubameyang on AP News",
```

## document.body.scrollTop = 0

Apparently this is all that you need to scroll to the top when, for example, you route to a details page, load the content, and want to see it, not the body of the json text.

However, that doesn't seem to work.

This does work in the result body of the service subscription:

```ts
window.scroll({ 
  top: 0, 
  left: 0, 
  behavior: 'smooth' 
});
```

Have to use that in Tundra 64 also.

## The CC link

It seems all the links to the Wikimedia image used are all pointing to the Naomi Osaka image used some time ago.

I can see for Alex that the source is set:

"source": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alex_De_Minaur_%2828938823637%29.jpg",

No mention of Naomi in his json.

Maybe it's a Tundra issue.  But it brings up a point with the mashup type.

Instead of making sources an array, we can use the 'two' object to hold the info for the second image downloaded.

That is the cheap way forward for now.  We are finding that we need more Wikipedia and news links.

In a mashup type, we would want two links to Wikipedia, and another link for the news story.

## Korean image search

The error right now is:

```txt

TypeError [ERR_UNESCAPED_CHARACTERS]: Request path contains unescaped characters

Searching for ì¡ê°ì¸ on wiki commons shows this url:

<https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=%EC%86%A1%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%B8&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image>

So those characters are encoded.  Just using encodeURI() works.

Next, the Wikipedia links need to be set by language.

Instead of this:

https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%86%A1%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%B8

We want this:
