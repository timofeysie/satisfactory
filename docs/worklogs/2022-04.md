How does this keep happening?

```err

```

Didn't we fix this already?

We did, however, it appears that when the backend encounters this error, it is unable to recover and needs to be restarted.  If the list is refreshed, it fails to load anything into the front end until it's reset.

This is the output on the backend:

```err
Successfully wrote file
default undefined.json
product.service: getCategory undefined.json
resolving undefined

C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\dist\apps\nest-demo\webpack:\apps\nest-demo\src\app\products\products.service.ts:47
        resolve(JSON.parse(file));
                     ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterOpen [as oncomplete] (fs.js:282:13)
```

Catching the error there if the file is undefined and returning the error, then restart the server.

Choosing load list shows this frontend console error:

```err
core.js:6456 ERROR Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: '27.524066666666666 minutes ago'. Current value: '27.524233333333335 minutes ago'.. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0100

```

Same for generate list apparently.  But it appears to work.

The NRL is investigating a physical altercation between Brisbane Broncos players Payne Haas and Albert Kelly that appeared to occur over the weekend. Haas can be heard in the footage calling Kelly a 'f****** c***', while Kelly repeatedly claims he didn't step on Haas' shoes. Haas was fined $50,000 and banned for verbally assaulting police last year. Kelly is expected to be sidelined for around 3-4 months with a foot injury.

The police have also launched an investigation into a fight.  They say the incident could have been more serious if the players were caught on camera using their mobile phones.

The Broncos have lost two of their first two games in the NRL season. They are expected to face a further suspension from the NRL after the incident.
