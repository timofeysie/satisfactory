## goto detail broken again

How does this keep happening?

```

Didn't we fix this already?

We did, however, it appears that when the backend encounters this error, it is unable to recover and needs to be restarted.  If the list is refreshed, it fails to load anything into the front end until it's reset.

This is the output on the backend:

```err

default undefined.json

    at FSReqCallback.readFileAfterOpen [as oncomplete] (fs.js:282:13)
```

Catching the error there if the file is undefined and returning the error, then restart the server.

Choosing load list shows this frontend console error:

```err
core.js:6456 ERROR Error: NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: '27.524066666666666 minutes ago'. Current value: '27.524233333333335 minutes ago'.. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0100

```

Same for generate list apparently.  But it appears to work.

The NRL is investigating a physical altercation between Brisbane Broncos players Payne Haas and Albert Kelly that appeared to occur over the weekend. Haas can be heard in the footage calling Kelly a 'f****** c***', while Kelly repeatedly claims he didn't step on Haas' shoes. Haas was fined $50,000 and banned for verbally assaulting police last year. Kelly is expected to be sidelined for around 3-4 months with a foot injury.

The police have also launched an investigation into a fight.  They say the incident could have been more serious if the players were caught on camera using their mobile phones.

The Broncos have lost two of their first two games in the NRL season. They are expected to face a further suspension from the NRL after the incident.

## Mashup type improvements

The 'two' imageUrl is set if the mashup steps are followed, but the "tags": "", and "source": "" are not set.

Man City vs Atlético Madrid

On the detail page, content is shown for both one and two.  If type is mashup, then we don't want descriptions and meta-descriptions for both.

After doing another mashup for Pakistan vs Australia, the source for one is not being set properly either:

```json
"source": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:",
```

We want the title to indicate it's about the image, not the event.

AI generated image for XXX format?  It needs to be brief:

That's why we need a counter on that field.

And we want to automatically be adding this blurb.  Possibly from a drop down list.

## Kickoff image generation doesn't

Possibly this is an error due to uppercase JPG file ext?

Yes, that was it.  Here is the kickoff output with the lower case extension:

Someone needs to tell Gimp to save it's images with a lower case file extension!

Or, we could account for the uppercase value...

## Todo

- snackbar for save list function
- custom topic search

## Custom topic search

The initial search is working for commons images.  However, there are no news articles which would normally come with a trending search.

Adding a summary of a Wikipedia page has been planned.  This feature can serve also as a substitute for the trending search list.

The list would just contain one item, which would be a link to the Wikipedia page, a summary created by Goose and the download/use checkbox.

Since creating the summary could take close to a minute, we might want to have a spinner, and probably don't need the download/use checkbox.  What would be helpful would be another update feature.  It might also be a good idea to have a kick-off button so that a wrong search summary is started which then cannot be cancelled and takes up processing power.

For now, we just need the summary.  This will also appear on the trending searches list as well.

That's a simple plan.  Create a dummy article object, and things should work as they normally do.  There is a catch however.  This error:

```txt
bart.controller.findOne: got id .txt
bart.service.loadSummaryById: .txt
loadSummaryById.loadSummary undefined
[Nest] 2748   - 21/04/2022, 9:53:28 pm   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open
'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\.txt' +7110137ms
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\.txt'
```

That's an easy fix, but then I think the articles will be too long for Bart, which means a lot more work to introduce the cut-up feature.

What file does the download go to?  I can't see any.  Also, there are a lot of junk files that could be deleted in the hugging-face directory.

Here is the current output:

```txt
bart.controller.getArticleSummary: article { link: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
bart.service.getArticleSummary: articleUrl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief 
bart.service getArticleSummary service err No model was supplied, defaulted to sshnn-12-6 (https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6)
generateText: Mischief Reefs
```

I wish we had a clear description of what every API does.  For now, we have the console log:

trends.component.ts:269 calling kickoffArticleSummary for <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief> Reef
trends.service.ts:31 kickoffArticleSummary for <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief> Reef

That service is a POST for /api/bart.  Why is it a post when the body is only a string?  I think that's because it avoids creating a whole new api, so using another route in the bart api which has similar functionality, but the GET is already taken.  Not a great reason.

It writes this file:

/apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/${filename}.txt

But no file is written for Mischief Reef.

bart.controller.getArticleSummary: article {
  link: 'https://www.mywabashvalley.com/news/mike-tyson-appears-to-punch-airline-passenger-in-wild-video-from-plane/'
}
bart.service.getArticleSummary: articleUrl <https://www.mywabashvalley.com/news/mike-tyson-appears-to-punch-airline-passenger-in-wild-video-from-plane/>
bart.service getArticleSummary service err No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 (<https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6>)

Why doesn't it work for Mischief Reef?

bart.controller.getArticleSummary: article { link: '<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief> Reef' }
bart.service.getArticleSummary: articleUrl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief> Reef
bart.service getArticleSummary service err No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 (<https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6>)

The wikipedia link is surrounded by <>, as far as I can see.

We can do this is the Angular service:

link: encodeURI(linkForSummary)

But then, we will need to do the same when the file is loaded.

Also, how will this affect the Google trend links?

The path to the Mike Tyson file is:

apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mywabashvalley.com%2Fnews%2Fmike-tyson-appears-to-punch-airline-passenger-in-wild-video-from-plane%2F.txt

The controller calls this Python script:

apps/hugging-face/src/goose.py

This should write two files:

file = open('apps/hugging-face/src/article.txt', 'x')
file = open('apps/hugging-face/src/articleSummary.json

It was actually writing the summary twice.

After that change, this is what gets written.

<goose3.article.Article object at 0x000001F31DA544F0>

The Tyson summary shows what it should look like:

[{'summary_text': ' Video obtained by TMZ Sports shows Mike Tyson punching a man on a plane leaving San Francisco International Airport . TMZ Sports reports that Tyson began hitting the man seated behind him on a flight scheduled to leave for Florida . The man was intoxicated, according to media reports . Video taken afterward appeared to show the man with blood on his temple . He had been in San Francisco for 4/20 festivities, KRON previously reported .'}]

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSubi%2520Reef.txt
bart.controller.findOne: got id https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSubi%2520Reef.txt
bart.service.loadSummaryById: https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSubi%2520Reef.txt
loadSummaryById.loadSummary <goose3.article.Article object at 0x0000014AB5F224F0>

I don't know why, but nothing gets written:

bart.controller.getArticleSummary: article { link: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subi%20Reef' }
bart.service.getArticleSummary: articleUrl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subi%20Reef>
bart.service getArticleSummary service err No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 (<https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6>)

We could always use the Conchifolia code to access Wikipedia.  That's also planned.  For now the user can cut and paste.
