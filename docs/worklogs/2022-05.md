## Add json file name to the exported articles json

How does that filename get generated?

Where are the functions that do it?

generateList() { }

  saveFile(articles: any) {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(articles);
    fs.writeFile('./articles/articles.json', jsonString, (err) => { ... }

The written file is here:

articles\articles.json

Is it OK to use that file directly from different projects on this laptop?  Previously I copy it over to Tundra, but now that the AMP frontend is being worked on, it needs to be copied there as well.

## Summaries

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\apps\nest-demo\src\app\bart\summaries\https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportingnews.com%2Fau%2Fsoccer%2Fnews%2Fchelsea-vs-liverpool-score-live-fa-cup-final%2Fiurgrbkbcgva0algwhqhpyeo.txt'

This is becoming a pain in the ass.  My first suspicion is that the target article is too long for goose.  How do we test that out?  Does this take precendence over the important story creation?

It's worth looking into.  Not sure which has priority.
