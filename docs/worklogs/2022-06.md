# June 2022

## TODO

- (done) add the aspect name at the end of the file before the file extension
- (done) return the name of the generated aspect image
- display the generated image
- allow the user to change the offset

## Work

Two weeks into June and still not able to display the generated image.  Sometimes the generated image also is not generated at all.

### add the aspect name at the end of the file before the file extension

Where is this done already?  There are a few places where the file extension is found.

It's a pretty small function in the trends.component:

```js
  removeFileExt(text: string) {
    const dot = text.lastIndexOf('.');
    const newText = text.substring(0, dot);
    return newText;
  }
```

Making that return the two parts, and now we have our correct file name:

Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9_2018-portrait.jpg

### Display the generated image

First error:

core.js:6456 ERROR Error: NG0201: No provider for TemplateRef found. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0201

That's what happens when you use ngIf without the asterix: *ngIf.

Next:

Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9_2018.jpg:1          
GET http://localhost:4200/dist/apps/public/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9_2018.jpg 404 (Not Found)

The template is here:

libs\trends\src\lib\containers\image-preview\image-preview.component.html

To get here:

/dist/apps/public/

So try this:

<img src="{{ './../../../../../../' + portraitData.path + portraitData.fileName }}" />

Same result:

GET http://localhost:4200/dist/apps/public/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9_2018.jpg 404 (Not Found)

### Nx shared images

To get a place to store the poster images so that they can be read, we either use the assets in the trends project, or follow this:

This [issue on Nx shared images](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/2230) says:

*The nx-examples repo has an example of storing shared assets in a lib. You can have app specific assets in the app assets folder such as maybe a specific logo or favicon just for that app. If assets are shared between different apps, you can create a lib with no typescript or anything and put them there. Unfortunately, you have to duplicate the assets config for each app which uses them but at least there is 1 copy.  Also note that nx won't find this dependency on it's own so we can add an implicitDependency to make Nx aware that those apps should be rebuilt when those assets change.*

The link for the nx-examples repo https://github.com/nrwl/nx-examples/blob/master/workspace.json#L49-L59

"shared-assets": "libs/shared/assets",

To generate a library:

nx g @nrwl/angular:lib shared-assets

*Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from @nx-example/mylib.*

Now, how to add the implicitDependency?

*Some dependencies between projects and shared files cannot be inferred statically. You can configure those using implicitDependencies.*

project.json:

  "implicitDependencies": ["anotherlib"]

I think that generate scaffolding command will do more than we need.  The above says *create a lib with no typescript or anything*, which seems to rule out Angular.  So what is the generic lib command?

[This is an open issue](https://github.com/productboardlabs/multioss/issues/9) from the above closed issue which mentions: *We might load assets from cdn for better perf etc. For that purpose it would be great to have ability to create libs, that encapsulate those static assets, that can be easily shared/used within other libs/apps*

That's an interesting concept.  I thought one option would actually be just to upload all created images to S3 buckets, and replace edited version, but actually I don't know how to edit/delete images from the bucket yet.

I suppose though, if it's going to be used in an Angular app, along with a TypeScript NodeJS app, then the above scaffolding command will be OK.  Let's find out.

Welcome to this projects 9th lib.

There is single file in the libs src directory:P

libs\shared-assets\src\lib\shared-assets.module.ts

Now how to add an assets directory.  I'm not sure actually if I did the right thing there.

 "shared-assets": "libs/shared/assets",

That's in the shared lib.  We called our's shared assets.  Well, it shows the shared directory is outside the src dir.

Next, add this to the trends lib project.json file.

"implicitDependencies": ["shared-assets"]

Actually, these are the details on the sample project from above:

apps/products/project.json

```json
  "tags": ["type:app", "scope:products"],
  "implicitDependencies": ["shared-assets", "shared-styles"]
```

We do have this:  nx.json

So should this happen?

```json
    "trends": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": ["shared-assets"]
    },
```

Not sure.  This is taking a long time I'm sure of.

*Angular developers can also configure projects in angular.json. Read this guide for more information.*

We don't have an angular.json file at all!  Sometimes I wonder why I set my self up for these complex problems.  I should have just been a UX designer...

Here we go.

*The project.json file contains configuration specific to its project. This file is often created when you use Nx Plugins. It configures custom executors, which are used instead of npm scripts. Custom executors are typed, toolable and provide a lot more flexibility for running long-live processes. They are also more composable.  If you're satisfied with npm scripts though, you will never see a project.json file in your workspace. But we encourage you to explore Nx Plugins and the power they bring.*

At the end of the demo project.json, we have the same as the above:

```json
  "tags": ["scope:myteam"],
  "implicitDependencies": ["anotherlib"]
```

So maybe what we have in the nx.json now will be fine.  

How do we test it out?  First, import it.

### Heroku login

I can't login as the MFA requires a code from my device, which was bricked and now have a new one.  How do I get a new QR code to setup the MFA on my new device?

*If you have lost access to your MFA device, follow our instructions to recover your account.*

*If you want to log in but don’t have your primary MFA verification method available, you can easily log in with a pre-generated recovery code.  Select Choose Another Option.*

But there is no "Choose Another Option" option.

I had sent an email to what I thought was the support email, but looking now, this was it: Heroku [undefined:noreply@heroku.com]

That's why that didn't work!

There is an [open question on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72021566/heroku-mfa-verification-using-a-recovery-code-does-work) about this.

I added a comment there: I'm having the same issue @heroku. If you select the forgotten password option, the next screen has an email to contact: account-lockout@heroku.com

I will be able to answer that if I get a reply.  This might improve my lowly 255 reputation points.

### The original images are not making it into the test_img directory

Request URL: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg/240px-ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 200

That network call looks OK.  But there is no output from the server.

Start in libs\trends\src\lib\containers\trends\trends.component.ts

Trying another image works:

['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg']

But with the Colorado Avalanche image, not.  That's a good thing to know.  What's the filename for that one?

Also, this is poor error handling.  If the download fails for some reason, there should be a message to show on the front end.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg/240px-ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg

trends.component.ts:465 download urls []


It is the ridiculous findExtension() function which wasn't looking for jpeg, only jpg.  I'm sure there are other ones also.  Really that whole rigamorole is terrible, and we should be getting the file extension for some meta data source.

Time to replace

dist/apps/public/

with

dist/apps/public/

ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg:1
GET http://localhost:4200/dist/apps/public/ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg 404 (Not Found)

On the server:

Yes, but:

libs\shared-assets\assets\Gabriel_Landeskog_-_Colorado_Avalanche_%28cropped1%29.jpg

imagePath 
dist/apps/public/ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg

libs\shared-assets\assets\ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg

Looks good to me.  Then wy the "bad extract area" error?

### bad extract area

What line is that error coming from?

### Input file is missing

(node:8080) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Input file is missing:dist/apps/public/Gabriel_Landeskog_-_Colorado_Avalanche_(cropped1).jpg
(node:8080) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). To terminate the node process on unhandled promise rejection, use the CLI flag `--unhandled-rejections=strict` (see https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_unhandled_rejections_mode). (rejection id: 10)

The actual file there in the shared assets lib is:

libs\shared-assets\assets\Gabriel_Landeskog_-_Colorado_Avalanche_%28cropped1%29.jpg

So it is an encoding issue here also.

We really need some logging to tell us where that is coming from without having to retrace the ui to service to controller to service.

(click)="onChooseSourceImage()" -> this.originalFileInput.nativeElement.click();

Then you have to look at the template native input element to see what it is attached to.

<input #originalFileInput
  (change)="sourceImageChosen($event)"

  sourceImageChosen(event) {
      const fileChosen = event.target.files[0]['name'];
      this.originalImageSelected.emit(fileChosen);

On the parent template:

  <demo-app-post-creation-form
    (originalImageSelected)="onOriginalImageSelected($event)"

That goes back down into this component where a behavior subject is waiting for a change:

            <demo-app-image-preview
              *ngIf="fullTopicForm.value.one?.imageChosen"
              [imageFileName]="fullTopicForm.value.one?.imageChosen"
            ></demo-app-image-preview>

this.trendsService.postImageMetadata(body).subscribe((result2) => {

This calls the POST: return this.httpClient.post('http://localhost:3333/api/image/', body, {

So look in the image POST API endpoint.

First of all, the logs are coming from async functions, so there could be a few lines from one fuction, and a few lines from another as they get their turn on the mystical Javascript event loop.

So having each line tell us where it's coming from is important.  But for now, we have console log.

Currently, after an image is downloaded and then images generated automatically, which is not going to work for stories.  I kind of feel like we need to have a new post type, so as well as 

Right now, it does work for other images.  But not for ColoradoAvalancheWarmup.jpeg.  Probably because of the extra long file extension is messing up our weak file type matching systems which is scattered all over the place because we assumed the code needed was too small to worry about making it reusable.

Anyhow, the image is not loaded into the front end after cropping:

```txt

libs\shared-assets\assets\New_York_Rangers_December_11th_2010_Lundqvist-portrait.jpg

There is no encoding issues.  That is the file.  So lets look at the shared-assets and trends lib config again.

Trends has this in the nx.json:

    "trends": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": ["shared-assets"]
    },

Maybe we also need to import it in the modules?

import { SharedAssetsModule } from '@demo-app/shared-assets';

Put that in the imports array, but still, the image is not found.  So back to googling after a short break.

### Share assets in the core nx tut

In the [nx core-tutorial](https://nx.dev/core-tutorial/03-share-assets) on step three it shows creating this file:

#### packages/ascii/project.json

```json
{
  "root": "packages/ascii",
  "sourceRoot": "packages/ascii/assets",
  "projectType": "library"
}
```

There is no packages directory for us.  How is that going to work here then?

The project is a bit off center.  Step 2 says "create a CLI written in Go".

That may be part of the more recent nx projects.  Here is the workspace directory structure begin in step 1:

```txt
myorg/
├── packages/
├── tools/
├── nx.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

Let's try it out.

## The packages directory

In the packages directory, there is a single empty file:

packages\.gitkeep

Whatever that is used for comes up in the next step installing something called Eleventy.

## Eleventy

Tried the same commands in a new nx workspace core project.

npm add -D @11ty/eleventy@1.0.0

What is Eleventy?

*A simpler static site generator. An alternative to Jekyll. Written in JavaScript. Transforms a directory of templates (of varying types) into HTML.*

Step 2. Then we create this file in the packages directory:

*Create a file at packages/blog/package.json with these contents*

But the serve fails.

```shell
 C:\Users\timof\repos\nx\my11> nx serve blog        
 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 >  NX   Running target "blog:serve" failed
   Failed tasks:
   - blog:serve
   Hint: run the command with --verbose for more details.
```

Same error for build:  >  NX   Ran target build for project blog (1s)     ×    1/1 failed

How to solve 'eleventy' is not recognized as an internal or external command?

npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev

### Image paths

<img src="{{ 'assets/' + portraitData.newFileName }}" />

New_York_Rangers_December_11th_2010_Lundqvist-portrait.jpg:1          GET http://localhost:4200/assets/New_York_Rangers_December_11th_2010_Lundqvist-portrait.jpg 404 (Not Found)

How to fix this?

I think the easy way is to just use an assets directory that would already work for this app.  Not the lib, as there is no assets directory there, and I think it would be the same problem trying that.  The lib is used in the customer portal app where this is an assets directory.

It has a git keep file there also:

apps\customer-portal\src\assets\.gitkeep

What is that file for?  *A GITKEEP file is an empty file that Git users create so that a Git repository preserves an otherwise empty project directory. By convention, empty directories that contain no files are not committed to Git repositories.*

So instead of replacing this:

dist/apps/public/

with this (which doesn't work)

libs/shared-assets/assets/

Replace it with this:

apps/customer-portal/src/assets/

(node:14668) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Input file is missing:dist/apps/public/Maiko_and_Reid.jpg

Why didn't the replace work?  I think maybe because I undid this file so that there is a trace later of the old filenames and it undid the entire global search and replace.

Do it again, and I saw the image for a brief moment, but then the Angular app refreshed?

Go through it again and, voila, the app refreshes.  That's a strange one.

Here is the log with preserve turned on:

```txt
this.portraitData {path: 'dist/apps/public/', fileName: 'Maiko_and_Reid.jpg', original: {…}, aspect: 'portrait', new: {…}, …}
2index.js:55 [WDS] App updated. Recompiling...
reloadApp.js:50 [WDS] App updated. Reloading...
Navigated to http://localhost:4200/trends
```

Can anyone guess what's going on?  I can.  All the files in that directory are watched, and the app recompiles on change.  How to exclude that directory?

On [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39869292/angular2-angular-cli-exclude-folders-from-automatic-build-watchers), someone seems to be asking the same question, to which user Ced
 with 14.2k reputation points says: "your app folder really isn't the place to upload user content"

And, I can't find any other valid answer.  This might be a real issue!  Maybe the shared-assets is the solution that has to work.

The other possible option is using another S3 bucket and keep replacing the files there.

Or can we make a service to send the images from another directory to the front-end to display.

Yes, that might be the easiest option, as [described in this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58683457/how-to-return-an-image-to-the-client-using-nest-js-framework).

Use a public directory to serve the images from.  This is the example code:

```js
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use('/public', express.static(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'))); // <-
  await app.listen(3000);
}
```

This [SO second answer by Abhay reputation 5,722](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63429380/how-to-serve-static-images-in-nestjs) shows two methods.  The first uses the app.module.  We need this first:

npm i --save @nestjs/serve-static

Then this:

```js
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join(__dirname, '..', 'public'),
    }),
```

Then we need a public directory.   Oh, we already have that.  It's empty.

However, the method to use it is not shown.  I would imaging one of these would work:

http://localhost:3333/public/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

http://localhost:3333/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

But I see a bunch of errors:

```err
[Nest] 9656   - 09/06/2022, 7:51:38 am   [ExceptionsHandler] ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\dist\apps\public\index.html' +71ms
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\dist\apps\public\index.html'
```

I can enter this in the browser to see the image there:

C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\public\Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

If the server was not running, that would work anyway, right?

So I suppose one way to make this work is to use an absolute path method.

Anyhow, we need to revert the directory change.

From this:

apps/customer-portal/src/assets/

to this again:

dist/apps/public/

Or should we use our new lib hoping one day it can actually be a shared lib for assets when we find out how to do it?

libs/shared-assets/assets/

If that dir that it's looking for is created: dist\apps\public\ and used like this:

http://localhost:3333/dist/apps/public/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

Still fails with the same error.  It's looking for a static website, not images.  Maybe it needs a config for image types?

[This SO has the same issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68019001/how-to-get-serve-static-images-nestjs).  There are two answers there that seem to contradict themselves.

After using answer one, the error changes:

http://localhost:3333/dist/apps/public/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

In the browser now, we see a 404 instead of a 500.

{"statusCode":404,"message":"Cannot GET /dist/apps/public/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg","error":"Not Found"}

No error in the node console.

Reading everything on StackOverflow and playing around with the config:

```js
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join('/public'),
      serveRoot: '/public',
    }),
```

TypeError: path must be absolute or specify root to res.sendFile

Another method would be to put this in the main.ts file:

```ts
  app.useStaticAssets(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'), {
    index: false,
    prefix: '/public',
  });
```

Looking at that that path translates to:

C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\dist\apps\public

Still doesn't help.  But then I found [this SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69552133/static-images-not-showing-in-handlebars-email-templates-using-nestjs) that does seem to work.  There actually was no answer, but the asker showed using setBaseViewsDir, and then, the public dir gets served:

```ts
  app.useStaticAssets(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'), {
    index: false,
    prefix: '/public',
  }); 
  app.setBaseViewsDir(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'));
  console.log('public directory: ', join(__dirname, '..', 'public'));
```

A note about this.  Those functions weren't available from app using this:

```ts
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
```

I had to change it to this (thanks to the issue [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/2354)):

```ts
const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule);
```

Now time for another search and replace.

Change this:

apps/toonify/src/test_img/

to this

dist/apps/public/

Yes siree!  Still not working.  Is this the way to reference those files?

```html
<img src="{{ 'dist/apps/public/' + portraitData.newFileName }}" />
```

or this:

```html
<img src="{{ 'C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public' + portraitData.newFileName }}" />
```

The second one I think.  Anyhow what's the exclamation mark doing in the file name now?

(node:21116) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Input file is missing: dist/apps/public/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs!.jpg

Not sure how that's getting there, but our filename creation function that we talked about earlier comes to mind.

The file chosen seems to be OK.

Request URL: http://localhost:3333/api/image/Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

getImageMetadata is failing.

That would be from the findOne function.  The file name is:

Colorado_Avalanche_Playoffs%21.jpg

So the encoded ! (%21) is the issue.

To encode or not encode, that is the question.

The console running Node shows the !, but the console in the browser shows the %21.

Just to confirm, tried another image and the directory is used correctly to create the cropped image.  But the rabbit hole goes even deeper:

But there is a broken image icon in the template.  Whoops, forgot the slash after public there.

C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Screenshot 2022-06-11 110604-portrait.png

This is actually an error and is blocked.

GET unsafe:C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Screenshot 2

That path works in the browser.

Trying the same file again later, no cropped image is generated.  And still, no image showing up in the template, so we are still not out of the woods yet.

ImageService.findOne: imagePath dist/apps/public/Screenshot%202022-06-11%20110604.png
(node:20684) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning:

The file in question:

C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\dist\apps\public\Screenshot 2022-06-11 110604.png

Maybe we need to *un-encode* it?  Or just remove the encode on the findOne, then it works.  But the template still wont show it:

unsafe:C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/SafeValue must use [property]=binding: Screenshot 2022-06-11 110604-portrait.png (see https://g.co/ng/security#xss):1          GET unsafe:C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/SafeValue must use [property]=binding: Screenshot 2022-06-11 110604-portrait.png (see https://g.co/ng/security net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME

This works to make the error go away, but I'm still not seeing the file:

<img [innerHTML]="'C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/' + portraitImg" />

C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/SafeValue must use [property]=binding: Screenshot 2022-06-11 110604-portrait.png (see https://g.co/ng/security#xss)

Even using trusted bypass security doesn't work:

Not allowed to load local resource: file:///C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Screenshot%202022-06-11%20110604-portrait.png

Oh, right, duh.  The server is running on port 3333.

Whoops.

GET http://localhost:3333/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Screenshot%202022-06-11%20110604-portrait.png 404 (Not Found)

The filename is still encoded.  And, it should be a file, not a server call.

file:///C:/Users/timof/repos/satisfactory/dist/apps/public/Screenshot%202022-06-11%20110604-portrait.png

That works in the browser.

No, we do have to user the server, remember?

Something like this works:

```ts
  getSafeUrl() {
    this.portraitImg = 'http://localhost:3333/public/' + newFileName;
    return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.portraitImg);
  }
```

Yay!

### Past tense

Kelly Slater is a good example of where the tense is a news story, but we want the tense of a painting label.

"Kelly Slater has won for an eighth time at Pipeline, 30 years after his first victory at the famous surf break in Hawaii."

Should be:

"Kelly Slater won for an eighth time at Pipeline, 30 years after his first victory at the famous surf break in Hawaii."

Here's [a start](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62945590/how-can-i-transform-verbs-from-present-tense-to-past-tense-with-using-nlp-librar)

And what should the title be?

### Failed Bart calls

bart.service.getArticleSummary: articleUrl https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a40255755/cooper-noriega-dies-age-19/
bart.service getArticleSummary service err No model was supplied, defaulted to sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 (https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6)

### Error caught at Subscriber [object Object]

When posting the Cooper Noriega post, saw this in the browser console:

trends.component.ts:223: Error caught at Subscriber [object Object]

However, the post did work.

### Trends by country

It's always interesting to see the same trend show up for two countries.

```txt
US trend: 500K+ Cooper Noriega
AU trend: 20K+ Cooper Noriega
```

That's 4% I believe.

The next day, the poor teen is a trend also:

US: Cooper Noriega death (200K+ searches)
AU: Cooper Noriega (50K+ searches)

That's 25%.  That's a good ball-park range I suppose.

### Showing the whole image

Using the mat-grid doesn't seem to work very well.  It would be nice to use a background image but even outside the grid, this dynamically setting the bg doesn't seem to work.

<div *ngIf="portraitData" class="image_container" [style.backgroundImage]="'url('+getSafeUrl+')'">

This doesn't work either:

[ngStyle]="'url('+getSafeUrl()+') no-repeat 0 0 / cover'">

### Proper aspects

The aspect ration for the unfortunate teenager is 1.364321608040201

original height: 796
original width: 1086

Currently it looks like we are creating a landscape image.

new height: 640
new width: 873

Linked In landscape should be 1200 x 627 and Portrait 627 x 1200.  So that's just switching the height and width.

Instagram landscape 1080 x 566
Instagram portrait 1080 x 1350

Here the width is constant.

So that should be the starting point.

After a bit of work, things seem to be as they should.

story_dog2_portrait.jpg  720 x 960
story_dog2_landscape.jpg 720 x 541
story_dog2_square.jpg 720 x 720

Portrait 720x982
landscape 738x541
square 720x720

The portrait looks a little off.

### Automatically center posters

This should be an easy one.
