# July Work

## Todo

- selected generated image broken
- Lindsey Graham generated image not uploaded to s3
- make post creation from stack at responsive width
- make sections collapsible
- make sections stack-able
- scrollbar cropping function
- story type generation
- set the author name from the logged in user
- replace demo server with nest server for login
- use author name plus id of model for generated image names

## Scrollbar cropper

### Previous notes from last month

Make sure the cropped scroll area is the same ratio as the cropped aspect.

The image should be full sized but scaled as the cropped image is.

After the user drags around the image to center it, they can choose a generate posters button that will kick off the model.

To create the correct size, we can use the same functions, except using the UI width as the desired width, and calculating the new height based on the desired width.

Create variables for these fixed lengths:

```js
  maxPortraitHeight = 960;
  maxLandscapeHeight = 541;
  maxDisplayPortraitHeight = 100;
  maxDisplayLandscapeHeight = 100;
```

The second two can be used to create display sizes.

First, convert the calculated sizes to display sizes the user can play with.

When the user wants to generate an aspect image, convert those display sizes back to calculated sizes to generate the poster images from.

Sounds like a few more weeks of work, to be continued next month.

### The action flow

Currently:

1. ngOnInit() listens to the _imageFileName BehaviorSubject
2. An image is chosen and setupPosters(fileName, sharpMetadata, 'portrait') gets the meta data
3. setupPosters calls trendsService.postImageMetadata for each aspect
4. the postImageMetadata service prepares a cropped poster aspect images from the original
5. preparePostBody determines the width and the height and calculates the aspect of the posters
6. setAspectData(newFileName, aspect, body) sets <aspect>Data and <aspect>Img for display

To create the scrolling offset creator images, we need to repeat step 5, but with new limitations for the smaller images to display.  So we need to create a new function from preparePostBody called something like prepareImagePreview.

prepareImagePreview or create imagePreview or something like that.

Here is the current API for that function:

preparePostBody(fileName: string, aspect: string, _metaData: any)

We want to use the created file data for an aspect instead of the original metaData, and calculate a set of new sizes for display, because we don't want to display the original image in the small 100px x auto display scroll container.

We don't need to calculate offsets I think, as they are already done for us.  Or do we need new miniturized offsets?  Yes, I think we do.  The offsets are for the posters from the original.

We needs display w/h and display x/y offsets.  I think I need to draw this out to understand the requirements here.  In the meantime, I might just let the user enter offsets manually and then regenerate the images from those.  Really, we have to get to generating the story.  Now we have posters, it's time to move on that.

### Using the max display heights

What was this for?

## Lindsey Graham generated image not uploaded to s3

## Input file is missing

file un-encoded
ImageService.findOne: imagePath dist/apps/public/Rybakina_RG19_(4)_(48199109407).jpg
(node:18260) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Input file is missing: dist/apps/public/Rybakina_RG19_(4)_(48199109407).jpg

The encode/don't encode issue is still a thing.

This file is showing up as "file un-encoded".

And the images are not loading once encoded:

Request URL: http://localhost:3333/public/Rybakina_RG19_%284%29_%2848199109407%29-portrait.jpg
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 404 Not Found

The actual filename is:
Rybakina_RG19_%284%29_%2848199109407%29-portrait.jpg

And the frontend is looking for:
Rybakina_RG19_%284%29_%2848199109407%29-portrait.jpg

Looks the same to me.

Request URL: http://localhost:3333/public/Rybakina_RG19_%25284%2529_%252848199109407%2529.jpg
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 200 OK

Since this works:

Rybakina_RG19_(4)_(48199109407).jpg (downloaded)
Rybakina_RG19_%25284%2529_%252848199109407%2529.jpg (original)
Rybakina_RG19_%284%29_%2848199109407%29-portrait.jpg

(4) => %25284%2529 or %284%29

That when we don't use the encoding.

When we do use this encoding method:

encodedFileName = encodeURIComponent(imageName);
encodedFileName = this.encodeUriAll(encodedFileName);

Then the files are generated, just not shown.  Even the Drake example wont be shown.

Whatever.  Nx reset doesn't work either.  Same thing.

leosvelperez [commented on Mar 16](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/8968): *it looks like you might have a project in your configuration with no value specified for the root property. That property is required and therefore, it would cause issues when it's not present. Please make sure that all projects always have a root property set in the configuration.*

We have an nx.json and a workspace.json.  The nx.json file has no root attributes.  In the workspace.json file, all projects have the root attribute.

Currently:

nx --version
14.4.2

I'm not sure what that was before re-installing it.  

Well, I realize now this should be the command:

 nx g @nrwl/angular:component components/image-previews -project=trends

This output is similar:

```txt
 nx g @nrwl/angular:component components/image-previews -project=trends
NX As of Nx 13, project configuration should be moved from nx.json to workspace.json/project.json. Please run "nx format" to fix this.

```

nx.json, the 'root' property for each projects object should be present /as @leosvelperez suggested/

nx.json:

```json
"projects": {
        "your-lib-name-1": {
            "tags": [],
            "root": "<the root of the lib>" <<<--- same root listed for the lib in angular.json
        },
        ...
}
```

*after this, you may need to run the nx format command*

```txt
PS C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory> nx format

apps\nest-demo\src\app\gan\bucket\Azealia_Banks_at_Mermaid_Ball_Paprika.jpg.json
```

After this, the serve doesn't work.  We now have big problems:

```txt

_I've figured out that it's some nx cache and tried to find how to remove it. Advice from StackOverflow helped me with that:_

rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/nx

Didn't work.  Got rid of node_modules.  Didn't work.  Something reformatted the whole workspace.

I think it was the nx format command.

## Starting over

Create a new nx workspace that works with version 14.

Scaffold all the commands then move the src folders over there.

We already have a checklist for that!

### 1. Create a new Nx workspace in your workshop folder

npx create-nx-workspace@latest
cd demo-app

### 3. Create a new app

```txt
nx generate @nrwl/angular:app --help
npm install @nrwl/angular
nx generate @nrwl/angular:app customer-portal --routing
nx serve customer-portal
git add .
git commit -m "generated customer-portal Angular app"
nx g lib --help
nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib auth --routing
nx generate @nrwl/angular:component containers/login --project=auth
nx generate @nrwl/angular:component components/login-form --project=auth
```

Update the auth.module.ts, app.component.html and app.module.ts files as shown.

Update the login.component.html, login.component.ts as shown.

Make a folder called 'data-models', add types and export the interface:
libs/data-models/src/authenticate.d.ts
libs/data-models/index.ts
libs/auth/src/lib/components/login-form/login-form.component.html
libs/auth/src/lib/components/login-form/login-form.component.ts

Add change detection.
libs/auth/src/lib/containers/login/login.component.ts

I think now a list like this is not needed.  It's best to just follow the steps and paste in the code as shown.  Each step can be confirmed and changes applied to the tutorial.

## 8 - Layout Lib and BehaviorSubjects

Branch: step-8-Layout-Lib-and-BehaviorSubjects

```txt
nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib layout
```

etc...

What else?  Nest?

nx generate lib data-models
nx g @nrwl/angular:ngrx --module=libs/products/src/lib/products.module.ts --minimal false
etc.  Lets look at the nx.json list:

```txt
  "projects": {
    "auth": {
    "customer-portal": {
    "customer-portal-e2e": {
    "data-models": {
    "layout": {
    "material": {
    "nest-demo": {
    "products": {
    "trendy": { <-- became tundra-64 >
    "trendy-e2e": {
    "trendy-ssr": {
    "pictures": { <-- I think this was only used within trendy >
    "trendy-layout": {
    "hugging-face": {
    "toonify": {
    "shared-assets": {
  }
```

A lot of these are not needed.  Non-working experiments that should have been deleted after they failed.  

The tight list with scaffolding commands:

```txt
"auth": nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib auth --routing
"customer-portal": nx generate @nrwl/angular:app customer-portal --routing
"data-models": nx generate lib data-models
"layout": nx generate @nrwl/angular:component containers/layout --project=layout
"material": 
"nest-demo": nx generate @nrwl/nest:application nest-demo --frontendProject customer-portal
"products": nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib products --routing --lazy --parent-module=apps/customer-portal/src/app/app.module.ts
"trends": nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib trends --routing --lazy --parent-module=apps/customer-portal/src/app/app.module.ts
"hugging-face": nx g @nx-python/nx-python:app hugging-face
"toonify": nx g @nx-python/nx-python:app toonify
```

Bear in mind, these dependencies need to be installed before angular and nest:

npm install @nrwl/angular
npm install @nrwl/nest
npm install @nx-python/nx-python

There were two for data-models.

nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib data-models --force:true
nx generate lib data-models

Couldn't find the material command:

nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib material

nx generate @nrwl/angular:lib pictures
