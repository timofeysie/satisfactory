# February 2023

The writing is on the wall for this repo.  This means, that, since last July, things have changed in this maintainers life.

Dusting off this repo just for a test run four months later results in the following:

```txt
>nx serve nest-demo
C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\node_modules\@nrwl\workspace\src\core\file-utils.js:244
    if (a.length !== b.length)
                       ^
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    at Object.filesChanged (C:\Users\timof\repos\satisfactory\node_modules\←[4m@nrwl←[24m\workspace\src\core\file-utils.js:244:24)

    at Generator.next (<anonymous>)
```

Wow, is this whole project screwed?  Leaving it for a few months, and then this?  Life is hard indeed for a developer.  At least I have a job.

I have since left Angular behind.  And, now ML generated art has become mainstream.  The SEO work I did is still valid.  My React/Preact front end work is still valid.  But the back end and admin app not so much.  Also, given an error from the node modules, it's enough to kill this project.

The solution is to delete node modules and run npm ci.

A brief test and the commons image was not downloaded.

```txt

ImagesService.search: fullUrl https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Kyrie%20Irving&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go
ImagesService.search: list 40
gan.service.kickOffGan: start all
UnhandledPromiseRejection: This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). The promise rejected with the reason "[object Uint8Array]".
```

Downloading the image manually and then kicking off the GAN also fails.

Not looking good.  This isn't going to get fixed.  If the app is not working anymore then it's truly the end of an era.

I can't find the method to call the python GAN script manually, so it's over.
