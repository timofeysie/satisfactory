## Dusting off satisfactory

Five months since running the app an noticing that the GAN is not working anymore.  However, it's been about a year since I have used this app seriously.

I have started a little exploratory work on predicting mega trends with another Nest.js node app, getting a little help from ChatGPT.

### Directories needed

From the main readme: *These directories need to be created manually at the moment if they don't already exist.*

- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/test_img
- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/gen_image
- ./apps/toonify/src/cartooned_img/cartooned_img
- ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries
- ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/gan/bucket
- ./articles/
- ./posts

However, I believe since updating to the latest nx repo system, things might have changed a bit.

On the hp lappy, I see these shortcut directories in my folders which I vaguley recall were being used:

- ./dist/packages/public/gan/<empty>
- ./dist/packages/public/img/<wikimedia images>
- ./dist/packages/public/list/articles.json
- ./dist/packages/public/posts/Alex.json etc
