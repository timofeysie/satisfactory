## The failing summaries

It seems like if a particular search fails then

NBC did confirm this past week that there will be a new episode airing on January 15 with West Side Story star Ariana DeBose as the host .

wait and see on some of those .'}]

It worked in an incognito browser, so possibly caching issues?

Turns out we were calling the bart.py, but had made changes to goose.py to use only that script.  Changing that brought back our summaries.

The OK, not OK error handling for goose and bart is still an issue however.

## srcset

The srcset field for two type artist does not expand like the input for one.

## <span class="padding">{{ article.timeAgo }}</span>

The cards are crowded.
## The snake

The trend detail article said:

WATCH: Mink drags snake across road in the Everglades
NBC2 News
X
COPELAND, Fla. – A pair of hikers caught the moment a mink crossed a road carrying a large snake in its mouth in Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park.

The bart goose said:

After failing field sobriety exercises, the 44-year-old was arrested and taken to the Naples Jail Center. The man was taken into custody after failing field\xa0obeseety\xa0exercises. He was taken to a local jail where he is being held on charges of DUI and possession of marijuana. The arrest occurred in Naples, Florida, at the time of the incident.

It seems like if must have gotten an ad for another story instead.
