## The failing summaries

It seems like if a particular search fails then

```txt
The id is for Lance Stephenson:
fullUrl https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Lance Stephenson&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go
loadSummary [{'summary_text': ' There is no new episode of Saturday Night Live tonight . NBC did confirm this past week that there will be a new episode airing on January 15 with West Side Story star Ariana DeBose as the host .

wait and see on some of those .'}]

It worked in an incognito browser, so possibly caching issues?

Turns out we were calling the bart.py, but had made changes to goose.py to use only that script. Changing that brought back our summaries.

The OK, not OK error handling for goose and bart is still an issue however.

## srcset

The srcset field for two type artist does not expand like the input for one.

## <span class="padding">{{ article.timeAgo }}</span>

The cards are crowded. Added some margin.

## The snake

The trend detail article said:

WATCH: Mink drags snake across road in the Everglades
NBC2 News
X
COPELAND, Fla. – A pair of hikers caught the moment a mink crossed a road carrying a large snake in its mouth in Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park.

The bart goose said:

After failing field sobriety exercises, the 44-year-old was arrested and taken to the Naples Jail Center. The man was taken into custody after failing field\xa0obeseety\xa0exercises. He was taken to a local jail where he is being held on charges of DUI and possession of marijuana. The arrest occurred in Naples, Florida, at the time of the incident.

It seems like if must have gotten an ad for another story instead.

### Commit "fixed the srcset logic"

## Download images

Using the getCommonsImgSource() we get this commonsImgSource:

But really we want this full size image:

What about .png file extensions?

I created a kind of embarrassing function called findExtension() which looks for the third dot in the img tag string and returns that with the dot, such as '.jpg' or '.png'.

Seems to work OK, until it doesn't...

You should use the link name (by default, the name of the linked service) as the hostname to connect to.
So just use host: 'db' instead of host: 'localhost'
```

## 18th

Fixed the issue with the truncated urls. This was due to a title with a dot in it.

This issue also turned up:

This is the summary created by the server:

```txt
loadSummary [{'summary_text': ' Calvin Kattar defeats Giga Chikadze by unanimous decision in featherweight fight . Jake Collier submits Chase Sherman in the co-main event . Kaitlyn Chookagian defeats Jennifer Maia in a rematch in a women\'s flyweight title rematch . Kattagian and Maia met in 2019; the
"Blonde Fighter" won a rematch last year .'}]
```

But the form gets pre-filled like this:

```txt
won a rematch last year.
```

And, the url download is causing this error:

```txt
gan.controller: downloadImage
links https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/1971_Chrysler_Valiant_%28VG%29_Regal_Safari_station_wagon_%282015-07-10%29_02.jpg

```

The url works in the browser indicating that this is a cors issue.

But we already use the setting in our nest app: app.enableCors();

I then used a different approach to the https lib.

```js
  @Post()
  async downloadImage(@Body() linkWrapper: any) {
    const name = this.parsePath(linkWrapper.links[0]);
    console.log('gan.controller: downloadImage', name);
    const writer = fs.createWriteStream('apps/toonify/src/test_img/'+name.filename);
    const response = await this.httpService.axiosRef({
      url: linkWrapper.links[0],
      method: 'GET',
      responseType: 'stream',
    });
    response.data.pipe(writer);
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      writer.on('finish', resolve);
      writer.on('error', reject);
    });
  }
```

The hugging face output needs to also use the name of the file so that a call for a particular topic brief will result in the correct file being loaded, not whichever was last time if there was an error.

Just using something from the json as the file name would work.

Here is what the json looks like:

```json
{
  "title": "Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ...",
  "timeAgo": "2h ago",
  "source": "ABC News",
  "image": {
    "newsUrl": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/australian-open-ash-barty-wins-naomi-osaka-amanda-anisimova/100774764",
    "source": "ABC News",
    "imageUrl": "https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQueliwziIoIBz2XL_Ot6rZE1U9yQbm-R4SLR94mH_53HWNAmJnTz2aVsJ3m0Agld7GuwxFL3Os"
  },
  "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/australian-open-ash-barty-wins-naomi-osaka-amanda-anisimova/100774764",
  "snippet": "Ash Barty will face Amanda Anisimova in the last 16 after the unseeded American ended Naomi Osaka&#39;s Australian Open title defence in a gripping three-set&nbsp;..."
}
```

We really need to start collecting the date.

This is not hacking it: date=now+7-d

While we are here, we also need to capture the originalTrendTitleUsed to create the description.

That title is what we should use for the file name.

"Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ..."

We will save that property, and use it for the filename like this

originalTrendTitleUsed: "Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ..."
Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open.txt

Or should the ellipsis be used? Is that OK for a filename?

Naomi Osaka defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Australian Open ....txt

I'm thinking that we should use just the current setup which uses the url to the source.

event https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/entertainment/meat-loaf-obit/index.html

So the filename on the backend would be

https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/entertainment/meat-loaf-obit/index.html.txt

If that actually works, and there are no errors going to be caused by that in the future, then that's fine.

Currently it's summary.txt.

What is the save and what is the load api functions?

```ts
@Get() findAll() { return this.bartService.loadSummary(); }
@Get(':id') findOne(@Param('id') id: string) { return this.bartService.findOne(id); }
@Post() async getArticleSummary(@Body() article: any) { ... }
```

The bart.service.loadSummary() function needs to get the name.

Can we encode the url, send it to the get/id and then call loadSummary that way?

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-22/australian-open-alex-de-minaur-through-to-fourth-round/100775774.txt

}

Need to use the built-in encodeURIComponent(summaryUrl) function:

bart.service.getArticleSummary: path ./apps/nest-demo/src/app/bart/summaries/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Fnews%2F2022-01-22%2Faustralian-open-alex-de-minaur-through-to-fourth-round%2F100775774.txt    
bart.controller.findAll
bart.service.loadSummary()

But the route is still using the get with no param.

OK, yeah, Fox Sports snuck in a result there and I didn't notice.  It works now.

What's next?
