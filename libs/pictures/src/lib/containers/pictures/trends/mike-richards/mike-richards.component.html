    On August 11, 2021, it was announced that Richards would succeed Trebek as
    host of the daily show, with Jeopardy! guest host Mayim Bialik hosting
    future prime-time specials and spinoffs. But on August 20, it was
    announced that he would step down after offensive comments he had made in
    the past emerged. The five episodes Richards filmed the previous day,
    the show's first day of production on the new season, are still expected
    to air in September 2021. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Richards_(television_personality)">Wikipedia</a>
