Career
Molan's first job in media was in community television in Canberra. She then gained a job as a reporter and presenter for WIN Television and moved to Sydney in 2010 to work for the Nine Network.[1]

In 2012, she joined The NRL Footy Show on a regular basis, appearing mainly on the "League of their Own" segment as well as being their roving reporter. In 2014, she has become a permanent co-host of the program working alongside Paul Vautin, Darryl Brohman, Beau Ryan, and former test cricketer Michael Slater. Molan has also appeared on The Sunday Footy Show as a regular since 2012, mainly doing the "Around the Grounds" segment reporting.[5]

In 2016, Molan was appointed host of The NRL Rookie, which aired on 9Go!.

Molan has previously been a fill in sport presenter on Nine News and Today. From December 2016, she was made permanent Friday and Saturday sport presenter on Nine News Sydney replacing Yvonne Sampson who moved to Fox Sports.

It was announced on 3 October 2018 that, after 24 years, The NRL Footy Show would be axed following the worst slide in ratings in the shows history.[6]

In December 2021, Molan resigned from the Nine Network to join Sky News Australia as a Primetime Contributor.[7]

Radio
In November 2020, Southern Cross Austereo announced that Molan, Dave Hughes and Ed Kavalee would replace Jamie Angel to host The 2Day FM Morning Crew with Hughesy, Ed and Erin Molan from Monday, January 18 2021. A one-hour highlights package will air nationally at 6pm across the Hit Network.

Controversies
Molan hosted Nine's Wide World of Sports' coverage of the 2017 Fast5 Netball World Series. In May 2017, in the aftermath of domestic violence charges against Parramatta player Semi Radradra being dropped, Molan was publicly slammed by a small number of fans and by sections of the media for supposedly painting Radradra as being guilty and not giving the player the presumption of innocence when the allegations were first aired. Molan was asked by fans and the media to make a public apology to Radradra but no apology was forthcoming; Molan had publicly stated that Radradra deserved the presumption of innocence, and rather than being specific about his case, her comments were about what the NRL's stance ought to be in the event of domestic violence being found proven against any player, regardless of calibre.[8]

From 2018, she became the sole host of The NRL Footy Show as well as hosting The Sunday Footy Show. In August 2018, Molan and The Sunday Footy Show issued former NRL player Dave Taylor with an apology after being accused of fat shaming the player during a video segment.[9]

In June 2020, Molan was criticized for mocking the name of Tongan Rugby League player Haumole Olakau'atu on the 2GB radio program The Continuous Call. Molan alleges that her nonsensical imitation of Olakau'atu's name was in reference to a previous discussion between the radio hosts where they grappled with how to correctly pronounce Pacific Islander names. Molan left the program at the end of the 2020 season.[10]

Personal life
Molan was born in Canberra[1] and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. She attended 16 different schools due to her parents moving regularly in support of her father's career in the Australian Army.[5]

Molan is the daughter of Major General Jim Molan, a former Australian Army officer who rose to prominence during the early reconstruction stages following the Iraq War and who was elected as a Liberal Senator for N.S.W. in 2019.[11]

In April 2017, Molan announced on The NRL Footy Show that she was engaged to partner Sean Ogilvy.[12]

In December 2017, Molan announced on Nine News Sydney that she was expecting her first child.[13] In 2018, Molan gave birth to a baby girl.[14]

She is a supporter of Liverpool F.C.[15]
