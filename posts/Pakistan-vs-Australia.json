  "description": "Nathan Ellis took career-best 4 for 28 while Inglis made 24 off 15 batting at No.3. Finch used his feet to advance at the quicks early in his innings but settled into a different set-up thereafter. Finch said he had a slight tinkering with technique after the wicket played nicely against the new ball. Ellis kept wicket for the first time in T20I cricket having played his previous five games as a batter.",
