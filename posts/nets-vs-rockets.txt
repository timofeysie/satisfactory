COMMENT
The Brooklyn Nets will end their short trip in Texas with a visit to the Toyota Center on Wednesday night to take on the Houston Rockets. The Nets are 17-7 (first in the East) and the Rockets are 7-16, good for 13th in the West, but they’re hot at the moment.

Brooklyn’s coming off a 102-99 win over Dallas on Tuesday. Kevin Durant led the Nets with 24 points (10-of-22) while James Harden scored 23 (7-of-13) and added 12 assists and 9 rebounds. Brooklyn was down by as many as 17 points in the third quarter, but the duo of Durant-Harden was crucial down the stretch.

Houston last played on Sunday, beating New Orleans by a score of 118-108. Christian Wood (7-of-13) and Eric Gordon (7-of-14) both scored 23 points for the Rockets.

Brooklyn’s won four of its last six games, but Houston’s on a six-game win streak. The Rockets’ streak began with an impressive 118-113 win over the Bulls on Nov. 24, a team that the Nets have lost to twice already this season.

Although Houston’s on a tear, the main storyline is that Harden is returning to the Toyota Center for the second time since he was traded to Brooklyn in January.

Brooklyn Nets vs. Houston Rockets betting odds, spread, over/under
According to WynnBET, Brooklyn is a six-point favorites over Houston. On the moneyline, the Nets are -250 and the Rockets are +210. The over/under for the game is set at 226.5 points.

Brooklyn Nets vs. Rockets prediction
Brooklyn clawed its way to a win on Tuesday night in Dallas, and even though Wednesday’s game is the second half of a back-to-back, the Nets should be able to escape with the win. Harden will likely get booed by Houston fans again, but he’ll have the prime opportunity to show them that he’s better off in Brooklyn with hopefully another all-time performance on his former home court.

We’re taking the Nets -6 and under 226.5 points.

Brooklyn 112, Houston 103.

Brooklyn Nets vs. Rockets TV channel
The Nets-Rockets game won’t be nationally broadcast, but it’ll be available on the local YES Network with tip-off scheduled for 8:00 p.m. ET.

4 best James Harden performances at the Toyota Center

COMMENT
Houston Rockets, James Harden
The Brooklyn Nets are in Texas for back-to-back games, beginning with Dallas on Tuesday and ending with Houston on Wednesday. The game against the Rockets will be extra special for at least one player: James Harden. He spent eight years in Houston before being traded to Brooklyn last January.

On March 3, Harden returned to the Toyota Center for the first time. After being “welcomed” back with a chorus of boos, the 2018 MVP finished with a triple-double. He scored 29 points, dished out 14 assists, and pulled down 10 rebounds in a 132-114 win.

On Wednesday night, Harden will have the chance to have yet another impressive outing on his former home court. Harden’s struggled for the Nets so far this season, averaging 20.6 points per game and shooting 40.3% from the field, but perhaps being back in familiar territory will spark him to break out of his slump and return to the player that Brooklyn knows he can be.

In anticipation of Harden’s return, let’s look back at his four best games at the Toyota Center with the Rockets.

4. March 29, 2015 vs Nuggets
On this historic night, 25-year-old Harden had the first 50-point game of his career against the Denver Nuggets in Houston. Before the matchup, Harden’s career-high was 46 points.

By halftime, Harden had 22 points and the Rockets were up 65-49. In the third quarter, he added 16 more points, with eight of them coming from the free-throw line. With a minute left to play in the game, Harden knocked down two more free throws to push his point total to 47. Not too long after that, Trevor Ariza found Harden in the corner, who knocked down a 3-pointer to hit 50 and solidify the 118-108 win over Denver.


The MVP candidate played 40 minutes and shot 12-of-27 from the floor (44.4%), including 8-of-12 from the 3-point line (66.7%). He went 22-of-25 from the free-throw line.

Harden’s performance marked the ninth time that a player for the Rockets scored 50 points, but it hadn’t been done since Hakeem Olajuwon had 51 in 1996. It was Harden’s 29th game that season scoring at least 30 points, and his seventh with at least 40.

During the 2014-15 season, Harden averaged 27.4 points and shot 44% from the floor.

James Harden’s huge night capped by questionable call in comeback win

COMMENT
Somehow, someway the Brooklyn Nets escaped with the 102-99 win over Dallas on Tuesday night. Initially, it seemed like the Nets were going to lose the first of their four road games after being down by as many as 17 points in the third quarter, but that wasn’t the case. Kevin Durant came alive in the fourth quarter and led Brooklyn with 24 points (10-of-22), but James Harden was right behind him with 23 points (7-of-13), 12 assists, and 9 rebounds.

What matters most is that Brooklyn found a way to win. Durant and Harden were vital down the stretch and helped the Nets outscore the Mavericks 27-13 in the final quarter. That’s what’s important.

Speaking of the final quarter, Harden was called for a foul on Luka Doncic as he was driving to the basket. Harden was adamant that he got all ball, and Steve Nash challenged the call. Maybe it was because Harden was back in Texas, but the luck was in his favor and the call was overturned.

It was a risky move by Nash. If Brooklyn would’ve lost the challenge, the Nets also would’ve lost their final timeout with 50 seconds left to go in a heated game. Instead, it ended up being a success… for Brooklyn that is.


James Harden’s overturned foul call leads to a win for the Brooklyn Nets.
Harden grabbed the ball while it was in Doncic’s hands, but the referees saw something more at first. After spending a few minutes reviewing the play and coming to the conclusion that Harden didn’t make contact with Doncic, the Nets and Mavericks made their way to half court for the jump ball.

Dallas won the possession, but then promptly missed a shot. After that, the win was all but secured for Brooklyn. If the call would’ve not been overturned, there’s no way to know for sure that the Nets would’ve been able to win that game.

We’ve said it once and we’ll say it again, Brooklyn needs Harden. Hopefully, the final minutes of Tuesday’s game boosted his confidence. After driving to the basket against Doncic, it looked like Harden got some of his power back after he helped to secure the team’s largest lead of the game (three points). Don’t challenge Harden one-on-one.


Following the victory, the Nets will make the short trip to Houston for a game against the Rockets on Wednesday on Harden’s former home court. If there’s ever been a time for him to return to his old form, it’s now.

HOUSTON -- — Eric Gordon scored 21 points before being ejected in the fourth quarter and Garrison Mathews added 19 as the Houston Rockets extended their winning streak to seven games with a 114-104 victory over the shorthanded Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night.

Before the streak, the Rockets dropped their previous 15 games. It's the first time Houston has won seven straight since winning eight in a row in November 2019.

“The adversity that we went through prior to this point has made it even sweeter," coach Stephen Silas said. “We’re feeling pretty good about ourselves."

James Harden had 25 points for the Eastern Conference-leading Nets on a night when NBA leading scorer Kevin Durant and LaMarcus Aldridge both sat out for rest. It was Harden’s second visit to Houston since he was traded in January during his ninth season with the Rockets.

The Rockets led by 17 to start the fourth quarter and the Nets cut the deficit to four before Houston pulled away.

Mathews, who had 12 points in the fourth, scored four in a 5-0 run that extended Houston’s lead to 109-97. Patty Mills made one of two free throws for the Nets before a three-point play by D.J. Augustin made it 112-98 with about two minutes to go.

“When you beat a team like that it means something," Mathews said. “This streak's been a huge boost to our confidence. It’s been a huge boost to our morale."

The loss snapped a six-game road winning streak for the Nets, whose nine road wins are tied with the Suns for most in the NBA.

The Nets shot just 8 of 33 from 3-point range, with Harden going 3 of 12 and finishing 4 of 16 overall. He was 14 for 16 from the line.

“I got the shots I wanted, for sure," he said. “I just didn’t make them.”

Harden received a fair number of boos when he was introduced and each time he had the ball early. But he got a warm ovation after a highlight video of his time in Houston was played during a timeout in the first quarter.

He formed his hands into the shape of a heart as he held them over his head and then moved them to his chest and smiled as the crowd cheered.

Harden said playing in Houston will always be meaningful to him.

“Very special," he said. “I spent some of my most amazing years here on the court and off the court.”

Cam Thomas had 18 points for Brooklyn, and Mills added 12.

A 10-0 spurt by the Nets got them within four with about 7½ minutes left. Harden capped that run when he made a 3-pointer as he crashed to the court after being fouled by Mathews and made the free throw for a four-point play.

Gordon was ejected soon after that when he received his second technical foul of the game for yelling at the officials about not getting a foul call.

Harden’s free throw after Gordon’s technical cut the lead to four, but a 6-1 spurt by the Rockets, highlighted by a 3 from Mathews, made it 104-95 with 4½ minutes left.

Houston led by as many as 20 and took control of the game with a 37-point second quarter.

The Rockets ended the third quarter on a 6-2 run, punctuated by a one-handed dunk by Kenyon Martin Jr. to make it 90-73 entering the fourth. Houston rookie Josh Christopher stole the ball from Jevon Carter and dished to Martin on the other end, and he sailed over Carter for the slam.

TIP-INS

Nets: Nic Claxton received a flagrant 1 foul for a foul on Mathews in the second quarter. ... Paul Millsap scored 10 points off the bench. ... Claxton had eight points.

Rockets: Jalen Green missed his sixth straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Kevin Porter Jr. missed his second game in a row with a bruised left thigh. ... Danuel House sat out with a sprained left ankle.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Christopher had a career-high 18 points off the bench on his 20th birthday.

“He’s been working at his game day in, day out," Silas said. “He played a really solid game on both ends of the floor."

Asked what it was like to have such a big game on his birthday, Christopher thought for a second before answering.

“Perfect, perfect day," he said.

Nets give Kevin Durant a rest day, won’t play vs. Rockets

Another Nets star may rest vs. Hawks
James Harden’s true return to Houston didn’t go well
How James Harden was received in Houston return
Coaches keep preaching process. Fans just want wins
HOUSTON — The Nets were down to a lone star for their game Wednesday night in the Lone Star State.

Kevin Durant rested against the Rockets on the tail end of a back-to-back. With All-Star Kyrie Irving out, that left James Harden as the only member of the Nets’ Big 3 to face the Rockets.

Starting center LaMarcus Aldridge also sat out for rest Wednesday.

“I told them [the media] have been really on me for giving them some rest so …” Nets coach Steve Nash joked when asked why the two veterans were sitting out. “No, I think obviously we know they’ve had a lot of minutes recently.

“I think they both wanted to play, but it was an opportunity to try to get a little bit of rest during this tough stretch. Especially without Joe [Harris] in the lineup, it puts more pressure on guys. We’re just taking a chance and rolling the dice a bit here.”

The lineup teaming up Durant, Harden and Aldridge with Patty Mills and DeAndre’ Bembry had a stellar net rating of 16.0 in 81 minutes coming into Wednesday.

Durant is logging 36.2 minutes, more than three minutes above his average from last season. After playing both ends of the Nets’ first four back-to-backs, he finally sat out after playing 40:30 on Tuesday in Dallas.

Meanwhile, Aldridge had started six straight games, averaging 16.8 points and 6.6 rebounds in 29.8 minutes.

“I know people may be concerned about my minutes and I got injured before and all this extra s–t. But we’ll figure that out if I get there,” Durant had said. “Right now I want to play basketball.”


What do you think? Be the first to comment.
Harden, Mills, Bembry, James Johnson and Nic Claxton started for the Nets, marking the first time that lineup has started together this season. It’s also just the fifth career start for Claxton.

Claxton was the logical stand-in for Aldridge. The young center played 20:57 Tuesday, including the entire fourth quarter, for his most action since returning from illness. Claxton finished with six points, nine boards a team-high plus-9.

Nets
Nic Claxton’s return to Nets could be just what James Harden needs
“Well it’s nice for us to have those options,” Nash said. “Nic being a versatile, athletic, defender and roller, LA being a scorer and an experienced veteran who understands all the concepts of both ends of the floor. It’s really valuable for us to have both.”

Having Claxton on the floor not only will give Harden a lob threat on offense, but also will allow the Nets to switch 1-through-5 on defense, and not be wed to drop coverage as they are with Aldridge.

“He gives us that layer where he can guard multiple positions and gives us versatility and a guy out there that can guard perimeter players but still protect your rim and rebound is an excellent option for us. So he definitely improves us at that end of the floor,” Nash said.

“We love his attributes and what he can bring to the team and how he can impact teams with our switching defense, but just in general defensively, he has different skill sets than anyone on the roster.”

City
The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The Nets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Barclays Center. They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other is the New York Knicks. The club was established in 1967 as a charter franchise of the NBA's rival league, the American Basketball Association (ABA). They played in New Jersey as the New Jersey Americans during their first season, before relocating to Long Island, New York, in 1968 and changing their name to the New York Nets. During this time, the Nets won two ABA championships (in 1974 and 1976). In 1976, the ABA merged with the NBA, and the Nets were absorbed into the NBA along with three other ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers, and Denver Nuggets), all of whom remain in the league to this day.

In 1977, the team returned to New Jersey and played as the New Jersey Nets from 1977 to 2012. Led by star point guard Jason Kidd, the Nets reached the finals of two consecutive NBA seasons (2001–02 and 2002–03), but failed to win either title.[10] In the summer of 2012, the team moved to Barclays Center in Brooklyn,[11] becoming the first major sports franchise in the borough since the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team in 1957.[12] Since moving to Brooklyn, the Nets have qualified for the playoffs on six occasions, including trips to the Conference Semifinals in 2014 and 2021.

History
Main article: History of the Brooklyn Nets
Further information: Brooklyn Nets accomplishments and records
The Brooklyn Nets were founded in 1967 and initially played in Teaneck, New Jersey, as the New Jersey Americans. In its early years, the team led a nomadic existence, moving to Long Island in 1968 and playing in various arenas there as the New York Nets.[13]

Led by Hall of Famer Julius "Dr. J" Erving, the Nets won two ABA championships in New York before becoming one of four ABA teams to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. Unlike the other three ABA teams entering the NBA, who played in cities without any NBA presence, the Nets were required by the NBA to pay an "encroachment fee" of $4.8 million (equivalent to $22 million in 2020) to the New York Knicks.[14] The team financed that payment by selling Erving's contract to the Philadelphia 76ers;[15] and the Nets went from winning the last ABA title in 1975–76 to having the worst record in the NBA in 1976–77. The team then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets. During their time in the state, the Nets played in two consecutive NBA Finals in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, led on the court by point guard Jason Kidd.

After playing 35 seasons in New Jersey, the team moved back to the state of New York, changed its geographic name to Brooklyn, and began playing in the new Barclays Center, starting with the 2012–13 NBA season.[11][16] The team's move from New Jersey to Brooklyn was approved unanimously by the NBA Board of Governors on April 13, 2012.[17]

Rivalries
Boston Celtics
The Boston Celtics were rivals of the Nets during the early 2000s because of their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[18] who claimed Martin was a "fake" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of "Wife Beater!"[19] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When the series returned to New Jersey, Nets fans responded, with some brandishing signs that read "Will someone please stab Paul Pierce?"[20] referring to a night club incident in 2000 in which Pierce was stabbed 11 times. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, "Our fans hate them, their fans hate us." Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the "beginning of the next great NBA rivalry" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002. Led by Kidd, the Nets advanced to the NBA Finals, and the following year, swept Boston in the 2003 playoffs.

On November 28, 2012, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[21] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike.

However, the rivalry appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[22] Celtics announcer Sean Grande said, "It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat, feeling the way they do about the Knicks, the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now."[23]

In the 2019 NBA off-season, the Nets signed point guard Kyrie Irving. Coming off two seasons with the Celtics, Irving was described as selfish by many critics. This impression caused many Celtics fans to blame him for the Celtics' inability to get through to the playoffs.

During a regular season game in the 2019–20 season between the Celtics and Nets, the Celtics' fans displayed their displeasure with Irving by chanting "Kyrie sucks" in TD Garden.[24] When the series returned to Brooklyn two days later, the Nets' fans chanted "Kyrie's better" in response to the chants in Boston.[25] The "Kyrie's Better" chants reference to how the Celtics signed Kemba Walker after Irving left for the Nets.

On May 30, 2021, a Celtics fan threw a water bottle at Irving following a Nets victory and a 3-1 lead in the series.[26]

New York Knicks
Main article: Knicks–Nets rivalry
The Knicks–Nets rivalry has historically been a geographical one, with the Knicks playing in Madison Square Garden in the New York City borough of Manhattan, while the Nets played in the suburban area of Long Island and in New Jersey, and since 2012 have been playing at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks–Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as the Major League Baseball (MLB) Subway Series rivalry between the American League (AL)'s New York Yankees and the National League (NL)'s New York Mets, and the National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the National Football Conference (NFC)'s New York Giants and the American Football Conference (AFC)'s New York Jets, the result of the boroughs' proximity through the New York City subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce intraleague rivals.[27] The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League has also taken on a similar dimension since the Islanders moved to Barclays Center in 2015.[28] Due to the Knicks being located in Manhattan and the Nets being located in Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry "Clash of the Boroughs".[29][30]

Toronto Raptors
Main article: Nets–Raptors rivalry
A rivalry with the Toronto Raptors began in 2004, after Raptors guard/forward Vince Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets.[31][32] However, the two teams did not meet in the playoffs until 2007, when the Nets defeated the Raptors in the first round series, 4 games to 2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 led to a 98–97 victory.[33] Seven years later, the teams met again in the first round, and the series went to seven games, with a game-winning block by Paul Pierce, giving the Nets the 104–103 victory.[34] The series was noted for controversy when Toronto Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri made derogatory remarks towards Brooklyn at a fan rally outside Maple Leaf Square in Toronto before Game 1. Ujiri later apologized at halftime.[35] The Raptors and Nets faced each other in the 2020 NBA playoffs in the first round, with Toronto winning the series four games to none.[36]

Uniforms
New Jersey Americans
Upon debuting in the ABA in 1967, the New Jersey Americans wore white and red uniforms. The white uniforms contained red, blue and white stripes, with the team name and numerals in red with blue trim. The red uniforms mirror the striping configurations of the white uniforms while the city name and numerals were in blue with white trim.[37]

New York Nets
1968–1972
Moving to Long Island as the New York Nets, they kept the original Americans template except for the location and team name. The white uniforms featured a script "Nets" lettering with a tail accent below, while the red uniforms featured "New York" in block letters (similar to the New York Knicks). Over the years, the letters and stripes would endure a few adjustments.[37]

1972–1977
The Nets changed uniforms upon moving to Nassau Coliseum. The white uniforms featured a thick blue stripe with white stars on the left, along with a red stripe and white outline. The team name is written in red block letters. The blue uniforms, which featured "New York" in white block letters, mirrored that of the white uniforms.[37]

New Jersey Nets
1977–1981; 1983–1990
The Nets carried the "Stars and Stripes" uniform to New Jersey in 1977. The white uniform remained the same but the blue uniform read "Nets" in front. The blue uniform later added "New Jersey" in white block letters inside the red stripe.[37]

1981–1983
Upon moving to the Meadowlands in 1981, the Nets briefly changed their uniform set. The white uniform brought back the "Nets" script from the original New York Nets uniforms, but the color scheme became blue with red trim. The blue uniform featured "New Jersey" stacked together in a similar script style, and the letters were colored in red with white trim.[37]

1990–1997
The Nets underwent a visual rebrand before the 1990–91 season. The white uniform featured a more futuristic "Nets" script in red with white and blue trim, while adding red and blue stripes. Initially, the Nets wore white and light blue gradient road uniforms that had a tie-dye effect, but switched to a solid blue uniform after only one season. Both blue uniforms featured the same "Nets" script in red with blue and white trim along with red and white stripes.[37]

1997–2012
The Nets updated their visual identity prior to the 1997–98 season, going with a deeper red and navy scheme with silver accents. The white uniform, which remained virtually unchanged throughout its history, featured the team name in navy with silver and red trim. The navy uniform featured the city name in silver with navy and red trim. The dark grey alternate uniform, used until 2006, initially went with the city name in navy with white and red trim, but reversed the color scheme to white with red and navy trim after only two seasons. This uniform was the only one to feature the "NJ" alternate logo on the neckline. The red alternate uniform, which replaced the grey alternate and became the primary dark uniform in 2009, featured the team name in white with navy and silver trim. All uniforms featured thick navy stripes with silver-outlined diamonds.[37]

Brooklyn Nets
2012–2017
Upon moving to Brooklyn in 2012, the Nets went with a simple black and white uniform design, with "Brooklyn" in front of both the white and black uniforms. They also wore three different alternate uniforms. A grey-sleeved alternate with "Brooklyn" in Dodger blue, was first used in 2013 as a visual recall to the Brooklyn Dodgers. A white-sleeved alternate with the team name in black, featured the same "Stars and Stripes" look from the 1970s. A dark grey sleeveless alternate, meant to recall the 1980s New Jersey Nets uniforms, featured the team name in white and the city name in white written inside a black stripe.[37]

2017–present
With the switch from Adidas to Nike, the Nets kept most aspects of their visual identity intact. The white uniform became the "Association" uniform while the black uniform became the "Icon" uniform. The Nets have had two different versions of the "Statement" uniform. The first set, with "BKLYN" in white, was in dark grey and featured the same stars and stripes look from the 1970s. The uniform was updated in 2019 to a lighter grey base and black/dark grey stripes, with "BKLYN" written in graffiti style designed by Eric Haze.[37]

The Nets also employed a fourth uniform option: the "City" uniform. The 2017–18 black "City" uniform featured the full team name spelled in white along with grey accents inspired from the Brooklyn Bridge. The following season, it was replaced with a black uniform featuring stylized Brooklyn camo patterns as a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G.. For 2019–20, the Nets wore white versions of the "Biggie" uniforms, but with Haze-designed "BED-STUY" graffiti lettering in front (a reference to Bedford–Stuyvesant where The Notorious B.I.G. grew up). The 2020–21 "City" uniform, which honors Brooklyn-born artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, is predominantly black and features "BKLYN NETS" written in Basquiat's style along with multi-colored striping.[37]

In the 2021–22 season, the Nets' "City" uniform featured visual references to the Nets' uniform history. The navy base and white stripe featuring silver diamonds recalled the 1997–2009 uniforms. The "Nets" wordmark and lettering were taken from the 1990–97 uniforms. A red stripe with white stars honored the "Stars and Stripes" uniform of the 1970s and 1980s. A modified version of the 1980s New Jersey Nets logo, replacing the New Jersey outline with the map of Brooklyn, was added to the right leg. The 1997–2012 shield logo, also tweaked to feature the current "B" alternate logo, was added on the waist.[38]

A fifth uniform option, the "Earned" uniform, is released occasionally and is exclusive only to the teams who qualified in the NBA playoffs the previous year. The Nets, by virtue of qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given an "Earned" uniform. The design featured the herringbone parquet style of the Barclays Center court in shades of black and grey, with Helvetica lettering inspired from the signs found at the New York City Subway.[37]

Culture
Mascot

The mascot of the New Jersey Nets was Sly the Silver Fox, who debuted on October 31, 1997 as part of the rebranding of the Nets for the 1997–98 season.[39] Prior to that, the Nets' mascot was an anthropomorphic dragon named Duncan the Dragon.[40]

After the Nets' move to Brooklyn, the team introduced a new superhero mascot named BrooklyKnight (a pun on the demonym "Brooklynite") on November 3, 2012. In his first appearance, he was lowered from the ceiling of Barclays Center amid sparks and fanfare and introduced by Nets public address announcer David Diamante: "Here to defend Brooklyn, he's the BrooklyKnight." The mascot was co-created by Marvel Entertainment, a sister company to NBA broadcasters ABC and ESPN. The character also starred in 32-page comic book published by Marvel titled BrooklyKnight #1, written by Jason Aaron with art by Mike Deodato.[41][42] After the Nets' second season in Brooklyn, the BrooklyKnight mascot was retired.[43]

Team anthem
On November 3, 2012, the Nets introduced a new team anthem titled "Brooklyn: Something To Lean On", written and recorded by Brooklyn-born musician John Forté.[44] The song is notable for its refrain, which features the "Brooklyn" chant that has been popular with fans in the Barclays Center.[45]

Brooklyn Brigade
The Brooklyn Brigade[46] is a group of fans who are known for their loud chants and passionate attitude towards the Nets. The group was founded in November 2012 by Nets fan—and Brooklyn native—Udong "Bobby" Edemeka.[47] That year the Nets were beginning their first season since making the transition to the Barclays Center from the Prudential Center (where they had played from 2010 to 2012). Edemeka attended a few early season games of the new Brooklyn team. At the time, the Nets were seen as an expansion team by the league and fans alike. Edemeka noticed that the team lacked a solid fan base in their new home, and decided to purchase tickets for a small group of roughly 20 fans who he noticed were regular followers of the team on the SB Nation online blog, NetsDaily.[48]

Brooklyn Brigade Logo.png
The Brigade—at this time—was not relegated to Section 114.[49] Instead, Edemeka would purchase tickets in whichever section he could, which often included nosebleed seats. The Brigade initially did not get much recognition from the Nets. Edemeka met with the CEO Irina Pavlova (of the ONEXIM Group), who was fond of the group's antics.[50] Although Pavlova was a supporter of the group, other members of the organization were resistant to showing support for the Brigade. During the 2014-2015 NBA season, however, the Brooklyn Nets organization began assigning seats to the Brigade in Section 114 of the Barclays Center. This section is adjacent to the press booth and gave the Brooklyn Brigade exposure on a regional level and then eventually on a national level.

During the Eastern Conference semi-finals in 2014, while the Nets battled the Miami Heat, Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center CEO, Brett Yomark, noticed the effect that the Brigade had on the arena, and he started to visit Section 114 distributing Nets' apparel. In 2016, the Nets hired Sean Marks as their general manager, who became an immediate supporter of the group.[51] During the 2018-2019 season, the Nets reserved section 114 for passionate fans, and called it "The BK Block."[52] Although the Brigade is an independent fan group of the Nets, The Block[53] comprises mostly Brigade members.[54]

Management
On September 18, 2019, Joseph Tsai, the executive vice chairman of the Alibaba Group, completed the acquisition of full ownership of the Brooklyn Nets. With the closing of the transaction, Tsai became NBA Governor of the Nets and its affiliates.[55] Additionally, former Turner Broadcasting president David Levy was named CEO of the Nets and Barclays Center.[56][57] On November 12, the Nets and Barclays Center announced that David Levy would step down from the CEO position he had assumed less than two months before. Oliver Weisberg, president of Tsai's holding company J Tsai Sports, assumed an interim CEO role.[58][59]

Ownership history
The original owner of the Nets franchise was trucking magnate Arthur J. Brown, who founded the team in 1967. The next year, Brown sold the team for $1.1 million to entrepreneur Roy Boe.[60] Due to financial losses suffered while the team was on Long Island, Boe moved the team back to New Jersey in 1977 and sold the team a year later to a group of seven local businessmen led by Alan N. Cohen and Joseph Taub, who became known as the "Secaucus Seven".[61]

After a lengthy ownership of the franchise and numerous unsuccessful attempts to improve the financial situation of the team, the "Secaucus Seven" finally sold the team in 1998 to a group of local real estate developers led by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz,[62] who called themselves the "Community Youth Organization" and wanted to move the team to Newark, New Jersey. The next year the group signed an agreement with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to form YankeeNets, a holding company that owned the two teams, and later also the New Jersey Devils, and increase leverage in future broadcast contracts by negotiating together. After receiving offers from several broadcast partners, including Cablevision, which held their rights at that time, YankeeNets decided to launch its own regional sports television called the YES Network.

YankeeNets failed in its attempts to secure a deal with Newark to construct a new arena in the city. By that point in time, tensions between the management of the Yankees, Nets, and the Devils had cause a rift between them, and a decision was made to split the group.[63] With their plan to move the Nets dead, the Community Youth Organization placed the team up for sale. After a short bidding process, the group secured a deal in 2004 with real estate developer Bruce Ratner to buy the team for $300 million, defeating a similar offer by Charles Kushner and Senator Jon Corzine of New Jersey. Ratner had purchased the team with the intent of moving it to a new arena in Brooklyn, which was to be a centerpiece of the large-scale Atlantic Yards development.[64]

Rapper Jay-Z owned a small minority stake in the Nets from 2003 until 2013. Jay-Z was a leader in the marketing for the team and helped encourage their move from New Jersey to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, in which he also held a stake. He relinquished his stake after registering as a sports agent with his new agency Roc Nation Sports, to avert any potential conflicts of interest.[65][66] His shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.[67]

On September 24, 2009, Mikhail Prokhorov, Russia's third-richest man according to Forbes, confirmed his intention to become majority owner of the Nets. Prokhorov sent an offer to the team owners requesting that the controlling shares of the basketball club be sold to his company, Onexim, for a symbolic price. In return, Prokhorov funded a loan of $700 million for the construction of Barclays Center, and attracted additional funds from Western banks. Prokhorov stated that he initiated the deal to help push Russian basketball to a new level of development.[68] On May 11, 2010, following approval from the other owners of NBA teams, Prokhorov had become the principal owner of the Nets.[69]

In late 2017, Prokhorov agreed to sell a 49% stake in the team to Joseph Tsai, with an option for Tsai to become the majority owner.[70] The option was exercised in August 2019, with Tsai also buying the Nets' arena, Barclays Center, from Prokhorov for nearly $1 billion in a separate deal. The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale to Tsai on September 18, 2019.[71]

Practice facilities
The Nets' practice facility and headquarters for the team's basketball operations are located at the Hospital for Special Surgery Training Center in the Industry City complex in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. The facility opened on February 17, 2016, and is built on the roof of an empty warehouse in the complex, occupying 70,000 square feet of space in total. The renovation project cost roughly $50 million.[73] The opening of the training center completed the Nets' move to Brooklyn.

The team's previous practice facility was at the 65,000-square-foot PNY Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which opened in 1998.[74] Prior to that, the team practiced at the APA Recreation Center in North Bergen, New Jersey, sharing their lockers and practice courts with truck drivers who used the facility.[74]

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, PNY Center suffered a power outage and extensive water damage due to flooding, and for several months, the team used the smaller training spaces and practice courts inside the Barclays Center instead.[75]

NBA D-League/G League affiliation
The Nets signed an agreement with the Springfield Armor to become its exclusive NBA Development League affiliate starting in the 2011–12 season. This made the Nets the second team to opt for a D-League "hybrid affiliation", the first being the Houston Rockets with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. Springfield ownership maintained control over business, marketing, and day-to-day operations, with the Nets having control over coaching and player decisions. This hybrid model was well received by GMs and owners.[101] However, after three seasons, the Pistons purchased the Armor from its former owners, and moved and renamed the team the Grand Rapids Drive.[102]

On November 6, 2015, the Nets announced that they had purchased a new D-League team to be called the Long Island Nets. The team played their home games during the 2016–17 season at the Barclays Center and then at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York after renovations were complete for the 2017–18 season. The Long Island Nets became the twelfth D-League team to be owned by an NBA team.[103]

The television home of the Nets is currently the YES Network, which the team helped create while they were under the corporate umbrella of YankeeNets LLC, a merger of business operations between the Nets and the New York Yankees. After the dissolution of YankeeNets and Bruce Ratner's purchase of the team, YES signed a long-term deal to keep broadcasting Nets games. The sale to the Ratner group did not include the percentage of YES that was previously owned by the Nets, which remains with the pre-merger Nets owners. Prior to that, the Nets' TV home was Fox Sports Net New York and SportsChannel New York.

The team's local broadcast partner is WWOR-TV, and games have aired on WLNY-TV in the past as well.

The current flagship radio station of the Nets is WFAN, which took over the radio rights to the Nets after losing their basketball contract with the Knicks (who moved to WEPN). Prior to that, Nets games aired on WNEW, WMCA, WVNJ, WNBC, WQEW, and WOR.

In the club's early ABA years, some Sunday road games were televised in a package carried by WPIX. The team's later ABA tenure featured more frequent road telecasts on their current broadcast partner, WWOR-TV. Known then as WOR-TV, it continued airing road games for a time once the team joined the NBA in 1976.

Television
Ian Eagle has been the sole television play-by-play announcer for the Nets since the departure of Marv Albert in 2011. Eagle became the lead television voice for the team in 1995 after serving as the team's radio voice for one year, while Albert joined the Nets following his firing by MSG Network in 2005 after four decades as the lead voice of the New York Knicks. When Albert joined the broadcast team, he became the lead broadcaster with Eagle as his substitute; beginning in the 2009–10 season, due to Albert's advancing age and his other commitments, Eagle once again assumed the lead play-by-play spot. Ryan Ruocco substitutes for Eagle during the latter's CBS NFL and NCAA commitments.

As of 2021, Sarah Kustok and Richard Jefferson provide color commentary on YES Network broadcasts, and Michael Grady serves as courtside reporter.[104]

Radio
WFAN is the Nets' current radio flagship, the station having assumed radio rights from WOR following the 2003–04 season. Chris Carrino and Tim Capstraw comprise the broadcast team, Carrino on play-by-play and Capstraw as the analyst. The games air on other Entercom-operated stations, such as WCBS (AM) and WNSH, when there are programming conflicts on WFAN.

Other broadcasters who have worked for the Nets include Howard David, Bob Papa, Bill Raftery, Kelly Tripucka, Albert King, Mike O'Koren, Spencer Ross, Mel Proctor, Joe Tait, John Sterling, John Minko and Mark Jackson.

Nets games have also aired on WNEW and WQEW in the past.

During the club's ABA years, announcers included Marty Glickman, Marv Albert's brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert, baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, Bob Goldsholl, as well as Sterling and Vince DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club's move into the NBA.
