Production
In July 2020, Kenneth Branagh announced that he would write and direct the film.[4] In September 2020, Judi Dench, Caitríona Balfe, Jamie Dornan, Ciarán Hinds and Jude Hill joined the cast of the film.[5]

Principal photography began in September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.[6][7] Filming initially took place in and around London, before moving to Belfast.[5][6] Production concluded by October 2020.[8] The film was shot in black and white.

The film features music by Belfast native Van Morrison, including eight classic songs and a new song Morrison wrote for the film.[9]

Release
Belfast had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on 2 September 2021[10][11] where it became the festival's most often-screened film of that year.[12] It also screened at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 2021, where it won the People's Choice Award.[13] By the end of its run, it will have screened at film festivals in Chicago,[14] Hamburg,[15] London,[16] Middleburg,[17] Mill Valley[18] Philadelphia,[19] San Diego[20] and Vancouver.[21] It held its Los Angeles premiere at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on 8 November 2021.[22] The film was released on 12 November 2021 through Focus Features in the United States and on 25 February 2022 in the United Kingdom through Universal Pictures.[3][23]

Reviewing the film for TheWrap, Steve Pond praised the performances of Dornan and Balfe, and said: "The film feels true in the way it must be exploring Branagh's memories of a tumultuous and confusing time, and the way it pays tribute to a vibrant community as that community is irrevocably changed."[27] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that "Branagh's genuine affection and nostalgia for his subject suffuse the movie; if only the misty romanticism of his story could match it" and gave the film a "B–" score.[28]

David Ehrlich of IndieWire, who gave the film a "C" grade, wrote: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, and this scattershot crowd-pleaser renders them both in such broad strokes that it seems as if Branagh can only imagine the Belfast of his youth as a brogue-accented blend of other movies like it."[29]

By Sonia Rao

Kenneth Branagh has never understood himself as plainly as he did while growing up in Northern Ireland. His relationship to the world was “completely clear and effortless,” the filmmaker says — the product of childhood naivete and the comforts of a close-knit neighborhood.

That dynamic changed suddenly in 1969 when rioting broke out near his home in Belfast early on in the Troubles, a period of violence between Irish nationalists and unionists that lasted from the late 1960s through 1998. On the cusp of reaching double-digits in age, Branagh was whisked away to England — a move made in search of a safer life but one that sent his secure sense of being into a tailspin.

Decades later, Branagh, 60, is finally grappling head on with the weighty emotions behind his working class family’s decision to leave familiarity behind. In theaters Friday, his film “Belfast,” a fictionalized glimpse into their final year living in Northern Ireland, begins with a mob storming through their once-idyllic street. From there, it focuses on a boy named Buddy as he tries to make sense of his rapidly changing environment.

In an interview last month with The Washington Post, Branagh says his parents rarely discussed the trauma of displacement, as though they were “committed to making good on the sacrifice.” The five-time Academy Award nominee has been directing for years but admits he hadn’t previously been in the right mind-set to dive into this particular story, either. Adapting Shakespearean plays and helming blockbuster movies such as “Thor” and “Murder on the Orient Express” can be transforming work, but it doesn’t necessarily prepare someone for the massive undertaking of processing their own life through film. It wasn’t until Branagh was staring into the silence of the early pandemic that he sat down to write about the first time his world turned upside down.

“Part of the Belfast condition would be that you never show off,” he says. “You never have ideas above your station. You do not think you’re better than anybody else. I couldn’t tell the story until I felt there was some recognition in it, that it wasn’t some navel-gazing act of my own.”

Largely told from a child’s perspective, “Belfast” is a much lighter watch than one might expect of a film set during the Troubles. Nine-year-old Buddy (played by newcomer Jude Hill) guides its vision of the city, sometimes literally — a selection of shots, including the ridiculous yet recognizable sight of a preacher yelling fire and brimstone at flinching children, were filmed from the boy’s eye level.

Buddy idolizes his parents, simply referred to throughout “Belfast” as Pa and Ma. He regards his father as though he were one of the movie stars they watch on-screen together at the local theater, actor Jamie Dornan portraying the industrious character with the mysterious air of a man who spends a considerable amount of time away from home, working construction in England to provide for his family. Caitríona Balfe plays Ma with a dose of glamour, also lending a stubborn streak to the dependable matriarch.

“It felt as though there was a kind of license, a freedom and a certain playfulness,” Branagh says of his decision to shape elements of the story around Buddy’s version of reality. A good portion of the runtime consists of the boy’s day-to-day interactions with his parents and grandparents (Judi Dench and Ciarán Hinds), as well as his endearing pursuit of a classmate he has a crush on.

“Belfast” has earned stylistic comparisons to Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma,” another project shot in black and white that revisits the filmmaker’s upbringing. But the new release might also recall elements of “Jojo Rabbit,” Taika Waititi’s World War II satire about a German boy who discovers his mother has been hiding a Jewish teenager in their attic. Branagh and Waititi highlight the absurdities of “us and them” mentalities by filtering politics through children’s lenses, the protagonists’ confusion interrogating why the divisive ways of being make sense to many of the adults around them.

Review: Kenneth Branagh’s memoir ‘Belfast’ is touching, entertaining and utterly irresistible

While Branagh overall opted for a more depoliticized approach to storytelling — he describes “Belfast” as a mood piece, floating from each childhood memory to the next — the film still makes it clear there are sides to the conflict at hand. Pa faces increasing pressure from fellow Protestants to turn against his Catholic neighbors, a dichotomy Buddy struggles to comprehend within his own life.

Among the most memorable scenes is one where Buddy chats with his cousin, Moira (Lara McDonnell), about how to differentiate between Protestants and Catholics based on their names alone. Names like Patrick are easy enough, they decide, but what about those that cross over? Buddy becomes flustered as the task grows more complicated, unsure what to make of his inability to tell the difference.

“It’s his version of what’s later explicitly put in a phrase that is very familiar to us these days — you’re either with us or you’re against us,” Branagh says. “The absurdity of that conversation [with Moira] is to underline how difficult it is to grow up with strong lines drawn.”

After Branagh moved to England, to a town about 40 miles west of London, he tried to disappear. He worked to “rub the edges off” his accent, he says, which in conjunction with later attending drama school and pursuing a career in acting led him to speak with the English accent he has today.

But no matter how English he became, Branagh never shed his connection to his Irish heritage. It’s that “cliched, glib-sounding phrase,” he says. “You can’t take Belfast out of the boy.” His parents — who weren’t too keen on “keeping up with the Joneses,” he adds — chose to raise their three children as they would have back home. The mentality shaped Branagh’s approach to art; he notes that the gallows humor scattered throughout his latest film is “very much a part of Belfast coping mechanisms.”

Branagh’s childhood also encouraged him to act on his learned belief that everyone belongs on an even playing field, opening doors to him he never thought possible. At one point in his life, the filmmaker says, performing Shakespeare “would have been like going to the moon.” He has since directed and starred in several on-screen adaptations of the playwright’s work — including 1989′s “Henry V,” which earned him his first two Oscar nominations — and once even played the bard himself.

“For me, it was very important that it was available to everybody,” he recalls of his adaptations. “I was like them, not needing to join some elite club and closing doors behind me. Quite the opposite. I wanted to bang on the doors, open them up and say, ‘We can enjoy it as well,’ you know?”

Much art has been produced about the Troubles, Branagh says, the subject “so immense and so complex that it can be hard for any film to do it justice.” He didn’t try to encompass it all, especially because his family experienced only the start of the violence. Framing “Belfast” around Buddy’s experiences was Branagh’s way of opening the story up to a broader audience, one that could not only relate to his childhood innocence but also the emotions stirred up by uncertain periods in life.

“This is from the point of view of someone who doesn’t even understand what politics are, but who is experiencing the unrest,” he says. “So as a filmmaker, I suppose I was trying to conceptually tell the story of how ordinary people deal with extraordinary events they can’t necessarily — certainly a 9-year-old cannot comprehend.”

Casting Black actors in period pieces isn’t diversity. It’s history.

Indulgence has long been a virtue and vice of Kenneth Branagh’s works. The British stage actor first forged his path in movies with a string of Shakespeare adaptations that he wrote, directed, and starred in as a leading man. When re-imagining Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein in 1994, he not only wore these three hats, but also wedged in a sequence where his mad scientist races around a laboratory shirtless. Branagh's muscular torso glistened with science goo as if he were about to pose for a Chippendales calendar.

This bold theatricality and unapologetic lustiness as a filmmaker brought oomph to 2011's Thor and 2015’s Cinderella, both of which were rightly praised for their sensual and spectacular fantasies. However, when it came to his Murder on the Orient Express in 2017, Branagh seemed so focused on his performance as the iconic detective Hercule Poirot that he left the rest of the cast to be lost in a sea of sloppy cinematography and clunky CGI. This same unchecked ego may have led to Belfast, an indulgent origin story masquerading as a crowd-pleasing family drama. 

Set in 1969, near the start of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Belfast follows three generations of a family witnessing the peaceful world they knew ripped to shreds by a conflict they don’t understand. An opening sequence shot in black and white ushers audiences into a charming neighborhood of rowhouses, where the neighbors all know each other and the children frolic carefree in the street. That is, until a violent gang of Protestants bombards the block, aiming to oust the Catholics living there. Through the eyes of young Branagh stand-in Buddy (Luke Hill), this riot is abrupt and completely confounding. To Ma (Caitriona Balfe) and Pa (Jamie Dornan), it is another source of tension for a marriage already full up. To Granny (Judi Dench) and Pop (Ciarán Hinds), it’s a sign that the homeland they knew may already be gone. 

Yet this is not a film about the Troubles. Not really. There will be scenes of ruffians bullying Buddy’s dad to join the cause. There will be clashes, looting, and tense sequences of a family scraping to survive a battle in which they want no part. But ultimately, the low-level war that would rage for decades is little more the volatile backdrop that plays behind a coming-of-age story inspired by Branagh’s own boyhood. It begins with this chipper child, skipping down his street carrying a wooden sword and a trash can lid as a shield. His days are filled with fantasy and fictional heroics (a nod to Branagh’s future artistic vocation). His daydreams come to vivid life when he goes to the movies, watching Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and other hits of the era, which play in bold color, reflecting their vitality. Buddy’s and the family’s faces are alight with joy in such scenes, reminding audiences of the power of movies — and once more pointing to where Buddy/Branagh truly feels at home. Then, for extra good measure, Branagh makes sure to include a shot where Buddy reads a Thor comic book...because he directed Thor. Subtlety has never been his strong suit. It’s never even been in his deck. 

While Buddy gets caught up in the movies and crushes on a blonde girl at school, his parents are grappling with far less cinematic problems, like crushing debt and an intensifying debate about whether they should leave Belfast behind. Beyond this, Pop is growing unwell. He brushes away any conversation on this point, preferring instead to talk to his grandson about love and the art of wooing. A warm Hinds and a spirited Dench dance and joke, welcoming audiences into the glow of lived-in love. But the lustiness of Branagh's other movies feels tamed, even when Ma and Pa have a rare moment to revel in romance. Still, these arcs allow Branagh to loosen the focus on his child alter ego and give voice to the grown man behind the camera, looking back in awe at the love and strength in those who made him who he is.

These scenes of familial mirth are suitably swooning, reflecting the wonder Branagh must carry for his family. However, he struggles at making his parents feel like real people. The grandparents, slightly irreverent yet respected, are familiar enough archetypes that they’d work well with any half-decent actor in the role. Branagh stacked the deck with Hinds and Dench, who easily evoke a storied history together and deep, knitted affection. With crackling chemistry, they nearly run away with this movie, while Dornan and Balfe are challenged to manifest depth in parents who aren’t much sketched out beyond strain and tenderness. There’s little nuance or in-between. So, Ma runs close to being a nagging stereotype, despite the grounded performance of Balfe. As for Dornan, his strong jaw and steady gaze are captured in cinematography with crisp close-ups, celebrating the stern masculinity of this patriarch and low-key likening him to a superhero in framing alone. But there's little clue as to what's going on inside his head. Instead, the insights into these grown-ups are presented through an eavesdropping Buddy, whose sweet face can’t carry the weight of such mature material.

Like the gorgeous montage of modern Belfast that sets the stage of this world, the movie refuses to linger too long on the ugly bits. Returning to Buddy is Branagh’s safe play, giving the audience a reassuringly cute kid whom you know will see no irreparable harm. After all, he has to grow up to go to RADA and become a big star. Branagh’s determination to give a soft touch to all troubles, be they marital discord, poverty, death, or The Troubles, undermines the movie’s message of resilience. The rapturous scenes — children playing, generations bonding, audiences communally experiencing a movie — whimsically represent the little graces that pull us through the dark times. By only timidly exhibiting such dark times, Branagh fails to draw as powerful a contrast as he might have. It’s as if he’s listening to the advice of his onscreen father, who tells Buddy, “Be good. And if you can’t be good, be careful.” 

It’s not that Belfast isn’t good, but it is too careful, coming off almost fearful of the subject matter at its center. It’s like Branagh is flipping through a family photo album, giving us curated glimpses of these relatives and their lives. No one frames the snapshots of the hard times. We prefer to brush past them. So in this tribute to his family, it’s understandable that Branagh gives glossy glances rather than hard stares at these characters. It’s a sweet gesture, but it leaves Belfast feeling big-hearted yet hollow. 

Belfast opens in theaters on Nov. 12.
